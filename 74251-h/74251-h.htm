</div>

<p>“Of those heroic men who were distinguished
in the American Revolution on land or sea, the
far greater part have been depictured by able
pens. Monuments have been erected, biographies
have been written, and the elegant historian
has adorned their memory with unfading
wreaths. * * * But there is one man
of no mean rank in the day of struggle—a
pioneer of our infant navy—who took more
prizes, fought more sea fights, and gained more
victories than, with a very few exceptions, any
naval hero of the age.”—From Shepard’s <i>Life
of Captain Samuel Tucker</i>.</p>

<p>“He did his part, and did it nobly, while our
navy was in an embryo state, and only consisted
of a few armed sloops and schooners, and
yet performed such essential service in supplying
the destitute army of Washington.”—From
<i>American Almanac</i>, 1835.</p>

<p>“It is well enough to bring the body of Paul
Jones across the ocean and bury it in American
soil with appropriate honors. But the nation
should not forget that another man—Captain
Samuel Tucker—lies in a neglected grave today;
yet no man captured more prize ships, or
did more to feed and clothe the army of Washington
than he.”—From <i>The Herald</i>, editorial,
1905.</p>

<p>The incidents of this book are taken largely
from the log-book of Captain Tucker, and are
intended to picture the stirring times in which
he lived, and the thrilling adventures in which
he engaged. Midshipman Arthur Dunn, one of
Captain Tucker’s officers, is the narrator, and
his story covers the five years during which his
commander played no small part in naval affairs.
It is hoped the narrative will arouse in
the heart of every reader an admiration for
the brave Captain, and rescue from oblivion
the name of another of our Continental heroes—the
man who did so much to keep the land
forces of our Revolutionary struggle supplied
with ammunition and stores at the expense of
the enemy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>I GO IN SEARCH OF CAPTAIN TUCKER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I cannot remember the time when I did not
love the sea, nor is that strange. I was born
in sight of the ocean. My father, and, as for
that matter, his father before him, was a sailor.
My first recollections are of boats and oars, of
vessels and ropes and sails. At fourteen I had
made a trip to the Great Banks on a fishing
smack and at sixteen my knowledge of the Atlantic
coast reached from Newfoundland to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Charleston. Tall for my age, strong and hardy
from constant toil and exposure, and familiar
with all sorts of sailing craft from a shallop
to a ship, I counted myself an able-bodied seaman.
I now had one ambition—to voyage to
foreign ports.</p>

<p>Suddenly, unexpectedly, the single cable
which bound me to the homeland was severed.
My mother—the only parent I can remember,
for my father was lost at sea while I was still
a babe—died. I left her in usual health for a
voyage to Norfolk. On my return I found her
dead and buried. In caring for a neighbor,
who was sick with typhus fever, she fell a victim
to the disease. A small cottage with its
scanty furniture, a few dollars in the care of
Squire Sabins, the village lawyer, and her
dying message—these were my legacy. It was
the message which changed the course of my
life, and sent me away from my native town
for years. It read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“My dear Boy:—</p>

<p>But for you I should rejoice over what the
doctor just told me—that I have but a few hours
to live—for it means a reunion with your dear
father, though a separation from you. It is but
a change from the presence of one loved one to
the presence of the other. Sixteen years I have
been with you, fifteen years away from him.
Now I go to be with him, and leave you to the
care of Him who has promised to be with the
fatherless. He will keep you in all your ways.</p>

<p>Doubtless you know that there is no tie to
keep you near home, and will carry out your
long cherished wish of visiting other lands.
You have my free consent. I was a sailor’s
daughter and a sailor’s wife. I believe ‘it is as
near to heaven by sea as by land,’ and have no
objection, as you long have known, to a sailor
son. I only suggest that you go to Marblehead
and find Captain Samuel Tucker. He was a
friend of your father, and will be your friend
and adviser. Possibly he may be willing to give
you a berth in his own ship; if not, he may be
able to secure a place for you with some other
captain as good and trustworthy as himself.
This much I am sure he will be willing to do for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
you for your father’s sake. Never forget the
great truths you have learned at my knee, and,
living by them, you shall some day join your
father and me in heaven. With my best love
and a kiss,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your dying mother,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Dunn</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Squire Sabins, who had been appointed my
guardian, though himself averse to the sea,
offered no opposition to my plans, and a week
later, with a new sailor’s kit and as fine an outfit
as a lad of my age ever had, I left for Marblehead
to look up Captain Tucker—a man whom I
had never seen, but about whom I had heard
from childhood, for, as the sole survivor of my
father’s wreck on the coast of France, he had
been the one to bring the tidings of that unfortunate
event to my mother. I arrived at
the village in the evening, and was left by the
stage at Mason’s Inn, where I passed the night.
Early the next morning, while I waited for the
breakfast hour, I went out on the street for a
stroll. Of almost the first person I met, an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
fisherman on the way to his nets, I inquired
for the residence of the man I was seeking.</p>

<p>“Capt’n Samuel, I ’spose you mean, seein’
how thar ain’t but one Capt’n Tucker here,” he
responded. “That big, gabled house, standin’
thar all by itself on Rowland Hill, not far from
the bay shore, is whar he lives when to home.
But he hain’t thar now. He sailed yisterday
from Salem for Lisbon.”</p>

<p>“You are sure of that, sir?” I asked with
much chagrin at the thought that I had lost by
a single day the man I was anxious to see.</p>

<p>“I orter be,” he answered good-naturedly,
“seein’ how my Bill went with him, rated as
an able seaman for the fust time, an’ I was
over thar to see them off. Bill will make a
capt’n yit, ye see if he don’t, for he’s with the
smartest skipper that sails from these parts,
who’s promised to do the square thing by the
lad.”</p>

<p>I was in no state of mind to dispute his assertion,
or to listen further to a recital of his
family affairs, which he seemed disposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
make. Thanking him for his information,
though it had not been to my liking, I turned
abruptly and went back to the tavern, where
the disagreeable news I had received was confirmed
by the inn-keeper while I was at breakfast.</p>

<p>I arose from the table out of sorts with myself
and uncertain what course I had better
follow. I knew I could go back to my native
town and reclaim the place I had given up on
the coasting schooner. But I did not want to
do that, now that I had bidden farewell to all
my friends there with the expectation that I
should not see them again for months, perhaps
not for years. I could not afford to wait, without
employment, until Captain Tucker returned.
Could I find some other ship in the harbor,
or over at Salem, on which I might secure
a berth?</p>

<p>Debating this question with myself, I tramped
about the town for several hours, visiting the
cliffs, the beach, the wharves, the old powder
house and Sewall fort. Occasionally I made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
inquiries about the seventy vessels of various
kinds which I could count in the harbor, but
while I found several opportunities to ship on
a fisher or coaster, I did not find a single
vacancy on a vessel bound across the ocean.
Towards noon I reached Red Stone Cove, where
there lay, stranded and broken in two, a long
boat, perhaps once belonging to an East India-man.
On the stern part of this disabled craft
I at length sat down and soliloquized:</p>

<p>“Evidently there’s no chance for me here,
and after dinner I’ll hire a boat and row across
to Salem, and try my luck there. Perhaps I
shall be more fortunate. If not, I can come
back here, and take a berth on a fisher until
Captain Tucker comes home.”</p>

<p>Little thinking the latter was the wiser
course for me to follow by all odds, I arose to
retrace my steps to the inn. As I did so I
noticed that a yawl had rounded the opposite
point, and was coming into the cove, apparently
crossing over from Salem. It occurred to me
that here might be a chance for me to secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
a passage over to that town in the afternoon,
so I waited the arrival of the boat. Soon it
was near enough for me to see that it was
pulled by two men in sailor garb, while a third,
whose dress and appearance suggested he
might be a ship’s officer, sat in the stern. In
another moment the light craft touched the
beach, and the last-named gentleman stepped
ashore. As I went forward to accost him, I
heard him say to his companions:</p>

<p>“Remain here, lads, until I return. I shall
not keep you waiting long if I have good luck
in finding the man I am after.”</p>

<p>“Aye! Aye! Capt’n,” they replied. “You’ll
find us here when you get back.”</p>

<p>Those words gave directions to the form of
my salutation, as I reached his side. Touching
my hat, I said:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Captain, but are you
just over from Salem?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, a little gruffly, I thought,
“but what is that to you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“Do you know of any vessel over there that
will soon sail for Portugal?”</p>

<p>I added that last word to my query, for it
had suddenly occurred to me that, if I could
reach that country, I might join Captain
Tucker over there as well as on this side of the
ocean.</p>

<p>“I do,” he admitted, “but why do you ask?”
and for the first time he looked me carefully
over.</p>

<p>“I’d like to ship on her,” I cried joyfully.
“Will you kindly tell me her name, and where
I can find her captain?”</p>

<p>“I happen to be her master,” he responded
affably. “Ebenezer Weston, of the brig
<i>Young Phoenix</i>, bound from Salem to Oporto
within a few hours,” he added with growing
politeness. “Now tell me who you are and
why you wish to go to Portugal.”</p>

<p>I promptly did so, without a single interruption
or word of comment from him until my
story was finished. Then he remarked:</p>

<p>“Arthur Dunn, son of Captain Thomas Dunn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and seeking for a place with Captain Samuel
Tucker. That’s all in your favor, young man.
Now tell me what experience you have had as a
sailor—what do you know of a brig and the
handling of her?”</p>

<p>Modestly I told him, saying I hoped to be
rated as an able seaman on the vessel which
shipped me.</p>

<p>We had been walking up the beach as we
talked, and were now out of the hearing of the
sailors who remained by the yawl, a fact
Captain Weston was careful to note before he
spoke again.</p>

<p>“I can do better than that for you, Arthur
Dunn,” he then said, “if you think you can fill
the place. <a id="second"></a>What I want is a second mate. I
came over here to look for a young fellow
whom I know slightly and whom I believed
would answer for the berth. He may be here,
and he may not. He might be willing to ship
with me and he might not. What is more important,
you are here, and are ready to go.
Now why can’t we strike a bargain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“I would do my very best, sir,” I stammered,
hardly believing it possible the man could be
in earnest in his proposal.</p>

<p>“You are rather young for the position, I
admit,” he said more to himself than to me,
“but you have had more experience at sea than
the man I was after, and the stock you came
from, as I happen to know, is excellent. Your
father and grandfather were born sailors, and
I believe it will prove so in your case. Anyway,
I’m willing to take the risk, and will tell you
what I’ll do. If you will sign for the voyage
over and back, and not join Captain Tucker
until he’s home again, which will be about the
same time we heave into port, I’ll rate you at
forty-eight shillings as a starter. How will
that do?”</p>

<p>“I certainly shall accept the offer, and thank
you for it, too,” I answered heartily. “When
and where shall I report to you?”</p>

<p>He thought a moment; then replied: “There’s
hardly room in the yawl for you and your
traps, and it would be something of a job to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
tote the latter down here. So you’d better go
back to the tavern, get your dinner, and take
the afternoon stage over to Salem. Let the
driver leave you at Long Wharf. I’ll have a
boat there for you. This completes my crew,
and we’ll sail on the morning tide.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be on hand, sir,” I promised, and turned
towards the village. Before I reached the bank
above the beach, however, he called out:</p>

<p>“Hey there, Master Dunn, I’m usually pretty
close mouthed about my affairs, especially here
in this town, so you needn’t say anything to
anyone about whom you have shipped with.
Just get your luggage and come over to the
brig.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” I answered, thinking little
then about the strangeness of this request.</p>

<p>A rapid walk of ten minutes took me back
to the tavern, where I got dinner, settled my
bill and clambered onto the top of the huge
coach that soon rattled up to the door.</p>

<p>“When shall we see you again?” asked the
courteous inn-keeper, following me out to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
stage, with an evident desire to learn more of
me and my visit to the town than he had yet
been able to ascertain.</p>

<p>“When I come back with Captain Tucker,” I
retorted, little knowing how true were my
words. “I’ve decided to go over the ocean
after him.”</p>

<p>“Your business with him must be important,
then,” he muttered as the great vehicle drove
away.</p>

<p>Something more than an hour later I was on
Long Wharf where I found Captain Weston
had been as good as his word. The two men
who had been with him at Marblehead were
waiting for me with the yawl, and, loading in
my kit, they took me swiftly out to as trim a
brig as I had ever seen. Mounting to her deck
I was warmly greeted by the man whom I, at
that moment, counted my best friend, but who
was to prove my greatest enemy before that
voyage was over.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>IN WHICH I DEFY THE CAPTAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Here you are safe on board the brig, Master
Dunn, and in good season,” Captain Weston
said as he grasped my hand. “I’m glad
of it, for I’ve changed my mind since I left
you, and we’ll heave anchor and be off tonight.
First of all, however, let me introduce you to
my first mate. Master Thomas Marshall, this
is our second officer, Master Arthur Dunn.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, a young fellow, who looked
scarcely older than myself, though I learned
later that he was just over twenty-one, stepped
forward and offered me his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“I’m glad to see you, Master Dunn,” he said
in a hearty way that quite won my heart, “and
I welcome you on board the <i>Young Phoenix</i>.”</p>

<p>Possibly my face revealed my surprise at
finding the executive officer of the vessel but a
stripling, for as I took Master Marshall’s hand,
the Captain remarked: “Yes, it’s the <i>Young
Phoenix</i>—young in name and young in age, for
she is only three years old, and what is more
fitting than that she should have young mates?
Ha! ha! ha!” and he laughed quite boisterously
over his attempt at pleasantry.</p>

<p>For myself, I thought his laughter unseemly,
and for some reason, though I could not then
have told why, it grated on my ears. But the
irritation I experienced was forgotten or overlooked
the next moment, for, turning to two
sailors who stood near, Captain Weston directed
them to take my luggage down into the cabin.
Then, speaking to me, he added:</p>

<p>“And come right along yourself, Master
Dunn. I’ll show you your quarters, and have
you sign the ship’s articles, and explain to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
about the watches. Then we’ll be ready to get
under weigh.”</p>

<p>In five minutes these preliminaries were attended
to, in ten minutes more the anchor was
hoisted, and, with all sails set, the brig was
standing out of the harbor. The breeze was a
good one, the vessel proved herself a good
sailer, and before sundown we were out of sight
of land.</p>

<p>I do not imagine there was ever a more complacent
lad than myself when I took the second
watch at eight bells, and found myself for the
time in sole command of the vessel. The night
was a beautiful one; the stars showed bright
and clear in the deep vault over my head; the
wind—a west one—bore us rapidly along our
course; the brig responded to every touch of
the wheel like a thing of life; and my own feelings
were in keeping with my surroundings.</p>

<p>I walked the quarter-deck with a slow and
dignified tread, occasionally pausing to direct
some member of my watch to tauten a rope, or
ease up a sail, or to keep a sharp lookout forward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Perhaps these commands were not always
necessary, but I issued them partly to
impress my men with the feeling that I, though
young, was equal to the place I had been called
to fill, and partly that I might test the working
of the vessel and familiarize myself with her
peculiarities. For, though you may not know
it, each ship has her own whims and moods, and
only he who is thoroughly acquainted with
them can have full mastery over her.</p>

<p>So the minutes rolled away, each new discovery
about the brig increasing my complacency
and giving shape to my thoughts. Here
it was less than forty hours since I had left
home, and, though I had not found Captain
Tucker, I was in a better berth than he would
have been likely to give or find for me, thanks
to my fortunate meeting with Captain Weston.
My quarters on the vessel were all I could ask;
the meal I had eaten at dusk had revealed the
fact that the captain was a good provider; the
first officer, Master Marshall, appeared to be a
good sort of a fellow and one I could easily get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
along with. On the whole, I was better off than
I had even dared to hope or expect.</p>

<p>So I mused, and among my musings was one
that took the form of a resolve: Captain Weston
should have no occasion to regret the confidence
he had put in me. I would do all that
was possible to win his approbation, until I had
been advanced to the position of first officer.
From that it would be an easy step to the command
of some vessel—and when that place was
reached I could go back to my native village
with pride and elation. Anyway, no more forecastle
for me. I was in the cabin, and there I
would stay until I was Captain Dunn.</p>

<p>I make mention of these thoughts here, for I
was soon to learn the lesson that there is a vast
difference between an idle fancy and the stern
reality. In fact, my complacency received a
rude shock almost immediately. Walking along
to Bill Howard, the oldest and most experienced
sailor on board the brig, who was taking his
trick at the wheel, I asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“How does she handle, Bill? Does she mind
her helm readily?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seed them that does better,” he
growled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, Bill,” I retorted.
“I call this a pretty fine craft.”</p>

<p>“She’s well ’nough, I ’spose,” he admitted
with some show of reluctance. “At the same
time Bill Howard wishes he wasn’t on board of
her.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the trouble?” I persisted. “It
can’t be they don’t give you enough to eat. I
saw the supper sent down to you tonight. You
don’t often get better on shipboard.”</p>

<p>“I wants no better, if it only continues,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“What makes you think it won’t, Bill?” I
questioned, thinking he might have been along
with Captain Weston on a previous voyage and
had some revelation to make. I had known of
skippers who always fed their crews well until
they got them out to sea. It might be this that
would prove to be the weak point of the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
with whom I had shipped so unceremoniously.
But his reply was a question.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but have you sailed
on the brig afore?”</p>

<p>“No, Bill, I haven’t. Have you?”</p>

<p>“Never, sir! and I can’t find anyone from
fust mate to cabin-boy that has.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, as though giving me
time to take in the assertion; then he continued:</p>

<p>“You’s young, sir, but I can see you are a
sailor. Now let me ax you a question. Does
it look well for a Capt’n when goin’ out of his
home port to have to ship all new men? Bill
Howard says no, an’ he’d never shipped on the
brig had he knowed it. Mark my word, sir, I’m
no croaker, but I’ll bet ye a month’s pay we’ll
both wish we were ashore ’fore we make port
again. An’ ’twon’t be the craft, sir; ’twill be
the ol’ man.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I guess it won’t turn out as bad as that,
Bill,” I replied with a laugh, and walked away.</p>

<p>But the conceit had been knocked out of me
by his words. I was not so sure that I had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
wise to jump so quickly at Captain Weston’s
flattering offer. I was not so certain I wished
to remain on the brig longer than for that voyage.
And I built no more air castles during
that watch.</p>

<p>A few minutes before the time for the
watches to change Master Marshall came on
deck. Surprised at his early appearance, I
went forward to meet him. As I reached his
side, dark as it was, I could readily detect that
he was troubled about something.</p>

<p>“Master Dunn,” he began immediately,
“may I ask if you are well acquainted with
Captain Weston? Do you know anything about
his habits?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” I answered with a sinking heart.
“I never saw him or heard of him until about
three hours before I put my foot on the brig.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m not the only fool on board,” he
remarked quickly, and I thought he said it with
considerable satisfaction. “My acquaintance
with him isn’t twenty hours old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>He was silent a moment, and then as though
some explanation was necessary went on:</p>

<p>“I belong in Eastport, Maine. My last berth
was as second mate on a brig in the West India
trade. We were wrecked a week ago, and a
Salem craft picked us up and brought us in
there. I’d hardly stepped ashore when I met
Captain Weston. He called me by name, said
he knew of me, and, being in want of a first
officer, would give me the place if I could
arrange to sail at once. Like yourself, I’m
ambitious to get ahead; it seemed too good a
chance to lose, and, as he was willing to advance
enough for my outfit, I promptly accepted the
offer. In two or three hours I made my purchases,
mailed a letter home, telling of my good
luck, and came aboard. As soon as I was
settled in the cabin, the Captain went over to
Marblehead after you.”</p>

<p>“Not after me,” I interrupted, and then I
explained how I came to be shipped on the vessel
as second mate.</p>

<p>“It looks bad,” he remarked when I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
done. “Captains don’t usually pick up their
officers that way. But doubtless some of the
crew are old hands, and we can learn from them
about the Captain.”</p>

<p>“No,” I declared, and then I told him of the
conversation I had just held with Bill Howard.</p>

<p>“It’s worse than I thought!” he ejaculated.
“New officers and new men throughout!”</p>

<p>“Why, what have you discovered?” I inquired,
coming at last to the question which I
had for some time been eager to ask.</p>

<p>“You’ll see for yourself when you go below,”
he replied, “though I don’t mind telling you.
He’s down there drinking like a fish, and is
already so he can’t tell whether he’s afloat or
ashore.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad it’s no worse than that,” I
said with a sigh of relief, “for I’m sure you
and I can manage the brig.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that that troubles me,” he responded
quickly. “But you see he’s captain
whether drunk or sober, and you can never tell
what freak a drunken man will take. No, Master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Dunn, we are in for it, and must stand together
so far as we can for our own protection
and for the protection of the crew.”</p>

<p>“You may count on me,” I promised, and as
the watches were now changing I started for
the cabin.</p>

<p>Once there, I found Master Marshall had not
overstated the situation. The room was filled
with the odor of rum, and a glass and bottle,
both empty, sat upon the table, while the skipper
was lying on the floor, now entirely overcome
with the liquor he had drunk; and there
he still lay four hours later when I again went
on deck.</p>

<p>It was not, in fact, until the next day at noon
that he came on deck, and I never knew a
greater change in the appearance of any person
within the same length of time than there was
in him. From the neatly dressed, affable gentleman
who had received me as I stepped on
board the brig, he had now become the ill-kept,
blear-eyed, irascible sot. Ignoring Master Marshall
and myself, though both of us were near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the wheel, he walked rapidly down to the galley,
where the cook was issuing food to the men.
Confronting that personage just as he came
through the door of the caboose, his hands full
of dishes, he angrily demanded:</p>

<p>“Who told you to give all that grub to those
land-lubbers?”</p>

<p>“You did, sir,” stammered the man in great
alarm. “Indeed, sir, I haven’t given them a
single thing more than you told me.”</p>

<p>“Take that for your impudence,” the irate
officer cried, and with his huge fist he struck the
fellow a blow which sent him sprawling down
the deck, while the dishes he carried rolled to
the opposite rail.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” he shouted as the unfortunate
cook regained his feet, “hear me! You are to
give the men just one-half what you’ve been
doing until further orders, and mark! if I catch
you adding a single pound to that, I’ll tie you
to the mast and give you twenty lashes with
the cat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do just as you say, sir,” the man meekly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
promised, as he began to pick up his stray utensils.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of the brutal incidents
we were called to witness or experience
through the remainder of our voyage. I have
no heart to write them out in detail here. But
let me say I have followed the sea for well nigh
sixty years now, sailing on all kinds of vessels
and with all sorts of masters, but I never saw
the equal of Captain Weston for meanness or
brutality. The men were starved and beaten
and worked nearly to death. I am sure there
would have been more than one fatality but for
the courage and tact of Master Marshall. When
the captain was in his drunken stupors, he
would issue extra food to the men on his own
responsibility, and so make up to them in a
measure that from which they were unjustly deprived.
In more than one instance, when the
commander in some ugly mood had ordered a
sailor to the lash, he would contrive to put off
the punishment until later, and, on the skipper’s
returning once more to his cups, the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
was allowed to go. But there were scores of
times when he could do nothing, for the Captain
liked to do the lashing with his own hands.</p>

<p>For a wonder I escaped any direct altercation
with the Captain until we had sighted the Bayona
islands off the coast of Spain. It was early
morning, the sky was overcast, and a heavy
wind was blowing from the north-east. I was
in charge of the deck and had sent Bill Howard
up the mainmast to belay a rope which had
broken loose. He completed his task, and
started on his return to the deck. Just then a
sudden gust of wind took off his tarpaulin, and
sent it scaling toward the cabin hatch. It
reached there as the Captain poked his head out
for a squint at the weather, and struck him in
the face with a force that must have stung him
severely. With an oath he leaped to the deck,
and, discovering Bill bareheaded, he turned
upon him with the fury of a maniac.</p>

<p>“You low-lived cur,” he hissed. “I’ll teach
you better than to throw your hat at me! Here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Master Dunn, tie the villain to the mast, and
I’ll give him forty blows with the cat.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, it was the wind that
took off Bill’s hat,” I started to explain.</p>

<p>“So you will excuse his devilish trick, hey?”
he shouted even more furiously. “Well, let me
tell you he shall be whipped, and what is more,
you shall give him the blows yourself. Here,
men, tie that fellow to the mast there.”</p>

<p>The last words were addressed to two sailors
who stood near him and they sullenly obeyed.</p>

<p>“Bring me the cat,” the angry officer commanded
when poor Bill, with his back stripped
bare, had been bound to the stick.</p>

<p>One of the sailors soon appeared with the
ugly lash, and the skipper, turning to me, remarked
with a satanic grin:</p>

<p>“Here, take this, Master Dunn, and for every
blow you give that does not draw blood on yonder
fellow’s back, you yourself shall receive
two.”</p>

<p>My blood boiled within me, but I answered
him calmly enough:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Never, sir! You may lash me, kill me, as
you please, but Bill is innocent and not a blow
will I strike.”</p>

<p>There was an instant hush, as the sailors,
aghast at my temerity, held their breath, and
the wind itself lulled as though anxious to know
the outcome of my defiance. Then with the
roar of a maddened bull, Captain Weston leaped
toward me.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>LEFT ON THE BRIG</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Clenching his fist as he came, he struck at me
with all his tremendous strength, and, had he
hit me, I am certain I should have been killed,
but I was on the alert, and jumped to one side
in time to avoid the blow. At the same instant
the wind came again with great violence, the
brig suddenly lurched, and my assailant pitched
headlong against the starboard rail, striking
his head with a force that knocked him senseless.
The fact that he was attacking me did
not prevent my hastening to his assistance.
But quick as I was, another was before me. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
was the first mate. He had come on deck in
time to witness the skipper’s fall, and was already
kneeling over the unconscious man when
I reached his side. Tearing open the Captain’s
waistcoat, he placed his hand over the heart,
announcing a moment later:</p>

<p>“He’s only stunned, Master Dunn. I’ll have
him taken down below, and do all I can for him.
But you’d better keep out of his way for a
while, and he may forget the whole affair.”
Then rising, he directed two of the sailors to
carry him down into the cabin. “Liberate
Bill,” he added as he turned to follow them.</p>

<p>I was not slow to obey that order, and as I
assisted the old tar in putting on his shirt and
jacket, he said:</p>

<p>“I’m obleeged to ye, sir, for what ye’ve done,
but I fear ye haven’t seen the last of it, an’ I’d
rather ben flogged than got ye into trouble.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Bill,” I assured him. “Come
what may, I shall never whip an innocent man.
I should have done the same for any of the
crew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“I knows it, sir, but Bill Howard won’t forget
ye’ve done it for him, as ye’ll see,” and he
went back to his station.</p>

<p>A half-hour later Master Marshall returned
to the deck, saying:</p>

<p>“He wasn’t hurt any to speak of. There’s a
big swelling on the top of his head, and he’s a
little dazed over what has happened. But it
don’t prevent him from going back to his rum.
He’s pouring it down again as if it were water,
and in a short time will be drunker than ever.
I only hope he’ll keep so until we are in port.
Then you can light out for Lisbon and join
Captain Tucker. It will be safer than to stay
here and face his anger when he does come to
himself.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do that unless I have to,” I
answered stoutly. “I’m as ready to do my full
duty by Captain Weston as ever, but I won’t
aid him in abusing innocent men,” and I explained
how it was that Bill Howard had
aroused the skipper’s wrath.</p>

<p>“I knew it was something of the kind,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
returned warmly, “for I was on deck in time
to hear what you said. But you never know
what freak a drunken man will take. He may
forget this whole affair, as I have intimated,
or he may hold the whole matter against you
until he’s had his revenge. My advice is to
leave the brig as soon as we are in port.”</p>

<p>“Why cannot we appeal to the consul?” I
questioned. “Surely he will take our word
against that of a drunken captain.”</p>

<p>“He may not give us the chance to make any
complaint against him,” he replied, “but we’ll
see. I only fear he will vent his anger in some
way on you before we can make any move to
prevent it.”</p>

<p>I tried to think that he was altogether too
apprehensive of coming trouble, though I confess
I finished my watch with much heaviness
of heart. Then, having determined to face the
worst immediately, I went down to my quarters
as usual for a much needed rest. No sooner
had I entered the cabin, however, than I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
for the present at least I had nothing to fear,
as the captain lay in a drunken stupor.</p>

<p>Throwing myself into my berth, I tossed
about for some time, thinking over the incidents
of the last hour or two. It seemed therefore
as though I had scarcely closed my eyes when
there came a call: “All hands on deck!”</p>

<p>I leaped to my feet, ran quickly to the ladder,
noticing as I ran that the captain was still lying
there in the same condition in which I had
found him on entering the cabin, and clambered
to the deck. A single glance told me why we
had been called. The storm, which was brewing
during my last watch, now raged in full force
and the brig, under shortened sail, was staggering
along before it, while the huge waves were
chasing her and threatening to engulf her.</p>

<p>Master Marshall met me at the hatch.</p>

<p>“How’s the Captain?” he inquired somewhat
anxiously. “Is he of any use to us?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest,” I replied. “He don’t
even know that I have been into the cabin.”</p>

<p>“Then, Master Dunn, we shall have to fight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
out the storm for ourselves,” he declared.
“That is why I have called you to the deck.
You must share the responsibility with me.
What more would you do than I have done?”</p>

<p>I ran my eye over the craft. All her top-sails
were taken in, but she still carried her mainsail,
her foresail, and her jibs. Under these
she dove her bow into the waves. It was evident
she was too heavy forward to ride easily
under the gale, so I said promptly:</p>

<p>“I’d take in every stitch of canvas but the
jib and mainsail, sir, and reef those down to
just enough to keep her steady. Then I’d ease
her off a point or two from her course; it’ll
keep her from diving into the seas that are
threatening to swamp her.”</p>

<p>“It’ll keep her off shore and give us more
sea room,” he admitted, “and as neither of us
is acquainted in here, it isn’t a bad idea;” and
then he gave the orders necessary to put my
suggestions into execution.</p>

<p>For hours we kept on under the reefed canvas,
the storm scarcely changing in its violence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Drenched to the skin, chilled to the bone,
hungry from long fasting, we were in poor condition
to meet the night which was now fast approaching.
Since noon our hatches had been
lashed down, and we knew nothing of what was
going on in the cabin. If the skipper had
aroused sufficiently to realize we were struggling
with the tempest, he gave no signs of it.</p>

<p>We looked for no help from him. Still,
assistance was to be providentially furnished
us.</p>

<p>“Sloop ahoy!” shouted the forward lookout.</p>

<p>“Where away?” asked Master Marshall,
hastening towards the bow.</p>

<p>“Two points off our larboard, and bearing
straight down this way, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“She’s a pilot boat, sir,” Bill Howard declared
a moment later to me. “I’ve seen ’em
too many times in here to be mistaken.”</p>

<p>He was right, for within five minutes she had
run near enough for her commander to hail us
in English and ask if we wished him to send a
man on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Yes, sir,” responded Master Marshall at the
top of his lungs. Then he said to me in lower
tones: “This is a Godsend, Master Dunn,
though I don’t see how he can put a man aboard
of us. No boat can live in this sea.”</p>

<p>But the Portuguese commander was equal to
the occasion. Working up under our lee, he
tossed a rope to our deck, the other end of
which had already been made fast to the waist
of the man he was going to send over to us; and
no sooner did this fellow see we had caught the
line than he plunged into the sea and swam
vigorously for us. We speedily pulled him on
board, well drenched but none the worse for his
voluntary bath. He could speak enough
English to make us understand we were only
about thirty miles out of Oporto, into which he
could take us, notwithstanding the darkness and
storm. Greatly relieved, Master Marshall surrendered
the command of the brig to him, and
under his orders we were soon headed for that
city.</p>

<p>Slowly the hours wore away, and as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
passed the wind decreased somewhat in its violence,
and the sea became less boisterous. It
was evident the storm was abating, and new
hope filled the hearts of all. Then when the
pilot at length declared we were approaching
the outer harbor of our desired haven, a cheer
broke from the lips of the worn and weary
sailors. Five minutes later, however, the newborn
hope was suddenly changed to the gravest
anxiety.</p>

<p>“Breakers!” called out the bowman, and the
pilot himself ran forward at the cry.</p>

<p>“It’s long reef, off harbor,” he said a
minute later in his broken English. “Drifted
too far south; I soon clear them though.”</p>

<p>But he could not keep his promise. An adverse
current as well as an adverse wind was
against us, and soon he declared our only hope
was to anchor until morning, when with a flood
tide and daylight to guide us, we might sweep
over the reef. So we cast over our anchor, took
in all sail, and anxiously waited for the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>But it was not an easy place for a vessel to
ride, and before long we discovered we were
dragging our anchor, and making straight for
the breakers.</p>

<p>“Must take boats—only hope,” the pilot announced.</p>

<p>Before Master Marshall could issue a single
order, however, there came a loud rap on the
cabin hatch near which I was standing. Throwing
off the fastenings, I pushed the cover back
and out stepped Captain Weston.</p>

<p>In the darkness we could obtain little idea of
his appearance, but his voice sounded out loud
and clear, as he asked:</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble? Where are we? Why
have I not been called?”</p>

<p>It was a rather embarrassing situation, but
ignoring the last question, I replied:</p>

<p>“We are drifting on the long reef off Oporto
harbor, and the pilot says our only hope is to
take to the boats.”</p>

<p>“The pilot says so? Where is he? How
came he here?” the skipper next demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Master Marshall kindly, saved me from further
reply.</p>

<p>“Here he is, Captain Weston,” he said,
bringing the Portuguese forward. “He’ll tell
you all about our situation.”</p>

<p>Confronted by the pilot, and, apparently now
recognizing the danger the brig was in, the captain
made no further allusions to our neglect
of him, but listened attentively to what the fellow
had to say.</p>

<p>Though dumbfounded that he was now for
the first time brought face to face with the real
commander of the vessel, the pilot made a short
and straight explanation of the situation, ending:</p>

<p>“No time to spare, Capt’n, we soon be on
reef.”</p>

<p>Captain Weston had but to listen to understand
the force of these words. Already above
the howling of the wind could be heard the noise
of the waves dashing on the rocks, and every
moment the sound grew louder.</p>

<p>“Clear away the boats!” he commanded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
“Master Marshall, you and your watch may
take the first one. Let the pilot go with you.
Master Dunn, see that the second one is made
ready for you and your men. I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>His words were calm and dignified, and I felt
sure that in the common danger that threatened
us he had forgotten any animosity he might
have felt towards me. So I sprang to my station,
and saw that our yawl was lowered into
the tossing sea.</p>

<p>Master Marshall was first off, clearing from
the brig’s side without mishap, and then my
men tumbled into their waiting craft.</p>

<p>“Ready, sir,” I reported to the skipper, who
still stood near the cabin as though loath to
leave his vessel.</p>

<p>“All right,” he responded pleasantly, coming
promptly over to the rail. “You are
younger and sprier than I, Master Dunn, and
so I’ll swing down first, and you may follow.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” I answered, and watched
him as he disappeared in the darkness down
the rope. I even took hold of the line to steady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
it, for it was swaying violently with every heave
of the boat.</p>

<p>A moment later I knew he had reached the
yawl in safety, for the cord was relieved of his
weight, and so I swung myself over the rail to
follow him. The next instant the rope parted
below my feet and I was left dangling in the
air. For a minute I knew not what to do, then
thinking if the line had given away at the stern
of the craft, her bow was probably still holding
fast, I drew myself up as best I could to the
deck, and hurried over to the other fastening.
Swinging for the second time over the rail, I
endeavored to lower myself down to the yawl,
but as I did so I became aware of two things:
this rope was also loose, and someone else as
well as myself was clinging to it. Before I had
recovered from my astonishment at these discoveries,
the voice of Bill Howard cried out just
below me:</p>

<p>“Go back, sir! For God’s sake, go back, sir!
The Capt’n has cut you loose!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A DASTARDLY TRICK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was neither the time nor the place to question
this astounding announcement, so I drew
myself back to the deck of the brig as best I
could, and the next moment Bill Howard landed
beside me.</p>

<p>“What is it you say, Bill?” I now demanded.
“The Captain cut me loose? Then how come
you here? Tell me all about it,” for though I
knew Captain Weston was angry with me, I
could hardly believe he would vent his spite in
an act which imperiled my life.</p>

<p>“It’s jest as I tell ye, Master Dunn,” the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
sailor began. “I was a slidin’ down the bowline
when I heerd him tell ye to let him go
fust. Now ’tisn’t nateral for a Capt’n to leave
a stranded ship ’fore his men, an’ I smelt mice
’t once. So when my feet touched the boat I
stayed right thar, holdin’ on to the rope. His
feet hadn’t more than struck the stern when
I felt that end of the craft swingin’ off, an’
I knew what he was up to, an’ ’spected to hear
ye go chunk into the water. I let go the line
an’ leaned over the side of the boat ready to
grab ye when ye struck. But ye didn’t come,
an’ then I knew ye’d gone back to the deck an’
would come down the other rope. So I rose to
my feet to catch hold of it agin, an’ jest then
the Capt’n calls out: ‘We are all here, lads,
clear away.’ Jack Slade was next to me, an’
hearin’ the command, he whips out his knife
an’ cuts the line ’fore I could say a word. I
caught it though, an’ tried to hold the boat thar
till ye could climb down, but the waves swept
her out from under me quicker’n a flash, an’
all I could do was to tell ye to go back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>I grasped the honest fellow’s hand, saying
with much emotion:</p>

<p>“It was kind of you, Bill, to try to thwart the
Captain’s purpose, but you have lost your only
chance of escape by it. You’d better left me to
my fate.”</p>

<p>“Not by a long way!” he retorted emphatically.
“I told ye Bill Howard wouldn’t forget
your kindness, an’ I’ve come back to help ye
out of this scrape.”</p>

<p>“How?” I asked incredulouslv. “We are
drawing nearer the reef every moment, and
once we strike, it will be all up with the vessel
and with us.”</p>

<p>“We hain’t goin’ on any reef tonight,” he
persisted. “I thought it all out while holdin’
on to that line. Thar’s another anchor in the
hold. We’ll get it out an’ down, an’ ’twill hold
us till high tide. Then we’ll cut the cables an’
go straight over the reef into the harbor. A
vessel did it here much as ten years ago. I
heerd ’em tell ’bout it when I was here on the
<i>Sally Ann</i> from New Bedford.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>They say a drowning man will catch at a
straw, and I certainly was given new hope by
my companion’s words. Together we went forward,
got off the hatch, and with much difficulty
hoisted out the anchor, though we shipped considerable
water while at the job. To bend on a
cable and carry it astern, where we had decided
to put it out, was an easier task. But as we
were about to throw the iron into the sea, I suddenly
let go of it, crying out:</p>

<p>“Look quick, Bill. We are no nearer the reef
than we were a half-hour ago. I believe the
anchor we already have out has caught and is
holding.”</p>

<p>He glanced toward the reef, and then, letting
go his own hold on the spare anchor, answered
joyously:</p>

<p>“Ye are right, Master Dunn, an’ we can keep
this iron to hold us after we are over the reef.”</p>

<p>Five, ten minutes, we stood there watching,
ready to put out the second anchor if it were
needed. The darkness was so dense we could
not see far away, but our ears helped where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
our eyes failed, and the sound of the dashing
waves grew no louder. At length convinced that
the brig was no longer drifting, we crept under
the lee of the cabin, and waited with what
patience we could for the flood tide.</p>

<p>We had only one way of telling when it was
safe for us to venture across the reef—as the
water grew in depth the sound of the breakers
lessened. When, therefore, their noise had
practically ceased, we crawled out of our retreat
and went over to the stern rail.</p>

<p>“Will it do to cut loose now?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Bill replied. “We want all the
water under us we can get, but won’t want to
wait till the tide slacks. How long d’ye ’spose
we’ve been here!”</p>

<p>“Four hours,” I answered, making the best
guess I could.</p>

<p>The old sailor did not question my estimate.
“Then the tide won’t be clear for two hours
yet,” he responded. “We’d better wait a while
longer, I reck’n.”</p>

<p>We crept back to our shelter, and, in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
to form some idea of the passing moments, I
counted slowly to myself. My comrade evidently
proposed to leave all the responsibility
of deciding the lapse of time to me, for he said
nothing until I announced:</p>

<p>“An hour has gone by, Bill.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start,” he said. “If ye’ll take
the wheel, I’ll go forward, an’ cut the cable.”</p>

<p>I went aft, loosened the fastenings of the
wheel, and stood ready to head the brig for the
reef as soon as she was free. The next minute,
like a race horse, she whirled to the larboard
under a mighty gust of wind, and dashed away.
Before I could get her bow around we were on
the reef, and a grating sound told that her keel
was grazing the rocks below. It was only
momentary, however, for a huge billow caught
her, and lifted her clear of the obstruction before
she could pound a hole in her bottom, and
on and over the great barrier we swept unharmed.</p>

<p>By this time I had the craft headed for the
harbor, and the creaking of cords and the fluttering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
of canvas forward told me that Bill,
single handed, was trying to put sail enough on
her to steady her to her course. He must have
succeeded for she soon became easy and sped
on before the wind straight for the town, the
glimmer of whose lights I could now faintly see.</p>

<p>My only fear now was that we might strike
some sunken ledge, since I knew nothing of
the waters before me, or run aground on some
shallow bank. But of this fear I was soon relieved,
for Bill came aft and on reaching my
side, said:</p>

<p>“Let me take her, sir. I’ve been in here
afore, an’ reckon I can put her where she’ll ride
easy till mornin’.”</p>

<p>Gladly I gave up the wheel to him, and busied
myself getting our remaining anchor ready to
throw overboard when we were in a place of
safety. Steadily the waters grew less boisterous,
then the wind blew less violently, and I
knew we were getting behind the headlands
which enclosed the harbor. The lights of the
city also gradually became more distinct, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
after a while we began to pass vessels which
were out-riding the gale in safety.</p>

<p>I turned to my comrade. “Had we not better
anchor soon?” I queried.</p>

<p>“If you say so, sir,” he answered promptly,
“but I’m sure I can take the brig a mile nearer
town.”</p>

<p>I made no objection to this, and ten or fifteen
minutes later he handed the wheel over to me,
saying:</p>

<p>“I’ll go forward now, sir, an’ let down the
jib. Then we’ll put over the anchor.”</p>

<p>These tasks were soon accomplished, and
then we went to the caboose, built a fire, and
got what might be called our supper and breakfast
in one, for we had eaten nothing since the
previous noon. The meal finished, I asked Bill
to go into the cabin with me for a much needed
rest. But he flatly refused, saying:</p>

<p>“It’s no place for the likes of me, sir; I’ll just
tumble into my old berth, while ye take the
cabin. I’ll call ye, if I wake fust.”</p>

<p>It seemed as though I had barely closed my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
eyes when he aroused me. “It’s broad daylight,
sir, an’ our boats are comin’ back to
us,” he explained.</p>

<p>I sprang up and followed him back to the
deck. The storm had broken, the sun was at
least two hours high, and there, between us and
the town and coming down toward us, were our
two boats with their crews.</p>

<p>Silently Bill and I awaited their approach.
I do not know what his thoughts were, but for
myself I could not help wondering what would
be Captain Weston’s greeting. I hoped the saving
of the brig would appease his animosity, and
we might now be friends. For the sake of
peace I was ready to overlook his base attempt
to leave me on the stranded brig. In this spirit
I turned towards him, as he mounted the deck,
and waited somewhat anxiously his first words.</p>

<p>“So the brig drifted over the reef after all,”
he remarked not unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“We cut her loose at high tide, and sailed her
over,” I answered, and in a few more words acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
him with our experiences during the
previous night.</p>

<p>“Lost her anchor, did you?” he commented
when I had finished the tale, and I thought his
tones were growing sharp and crusty.</p>

<p>“We thought it better to lose that than to lose
the brig,” I responded as calmly as I could
under the resentment which was welling up in
my heart.</p>

<p>“Hump!” he ejaculated. Then he turned to
Master Marshall, saying: “Send all hands to
their quarters, sir, and give them their rations.
Then call me,” and he stalked away to his cabin.</p>

<p>The moment he was out of sight the first mate
grabbed my hand. Wringing it heartily, he
said:</p>

<p>“You have done a big night’s work, Master
Dunn. The whole city is talking about it. But
tell me how you and Bill came to be left on the
brig.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d better leave that for the Captain
to explain,” I replied drily.</p>

<p>But Bill Howard had no such notion, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
a look from Master Marshall blurted out the
whole story. As he proceeded the face of the
mate grew grave, and when the old sailor was
done, he turned to me, declaring:</p>

<p>“This is a serious matter, Master Dunn. To
desert you at such a time was little short of outright
murder. We must report it to the consul.”</p>

<p>“Let us wait a while,” I suggested. “If Captain
Weston only treats me fairly now, I am
willing to let bygones be bygones.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that would be the easiest way out
of the unpleasantness,” he admitted, “but unless
you are squarely dealt with, I am ready to
lay the matter before the consul. Remember
this.”</p>

<p>Thanking him for his offer, I asked about his
own experiences the night before.</p>

<p>“There is little to tell,” he answered. “The
pilot was able to direct us somewhat, and after
several hours of fighting with the wind and the
waves we reached the inner bay and were safe.
Landing about midnight, the old Portuguese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
took us to a sailor’s inn, where we were cared
for. Captain Weston had a harder time, and it
was nearly morning before he reached the
shore, a mile or two below the town: Staying
there until light, he came to the city, where he
finally located us. Scarcely had he joined us
when the pilot, who had left us to go to his own
home, ran back with the astonishing news that
the brig was anchored in the harbor. The captain
wouldn’t believe it until his own eyes had
rested on the craft and then the way he ordered
us to our boats and started us off here would
have made you laugh. I had, of course, learned
that you and Bill had been left on the vessel, but
had supposed it was because the second boat
broke away from her side before you could
board it.”</p>

<p>Two hours later the captain had the anchor
weighed and the brig brought within a few cable
lengths of the pier, alongside of which he expected
in a few days to lay her. Then he went
on shore, and was gone until night.</p>

<p>I was in charge of the deck when he returned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
and with a slight nod in recognition of my presence
he passed on to his cabin. He did not
appear again until about nine o’clock the following
morning. Then he came over to the rail
where I stood looking off towards a British
frigate which was anchored a half mile farther
off shore than the brig. There were many signs
of activity on board the man-of-war, and I was
confident she was getting ready to leave the
harbor. The same thought had evidently occurred
to the skipper, for as he reached my
side he asked:</p>

<p>“Do you think she is getting under weigh,
Master Dunn?”</p>

<p>His tones were cordial, and as pleasantly as I
could I responded:</p>

<p>“It looks like it, sir.”</p>

<p>“I must communicate with her captain before
she goes,” he then declared. “Will you take
over a note for me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” I answered with no thought
of what the outcome was to be.</p>

<p>“Get ready the yawl, and I’ll bring the missive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
at once. There is no time to lose,” he said,
and hurried away to the cabin.</p>

<p>The boat was lowered, and four sailors were
at the oars when he reappeared. Taking the letter
from his hand, I swung down into the craft,
and gave the order:</p>

<p>“Heave away, lads!”</p>

<p>As we left the side of the brig, he called out:</p>

<p>“Deliver the letter to Captain Rawlins himself,
Master Dunn.”</p>

<p>“Aye! aye! sir,” I responded.</p>

<p>We made quick time to the frigate’s side, and
to my hail: “Ship ahoy! I have a message for
your captain,” an officer standing near the starboard
rail answered: “Boat ahoy! We are
waiting for you. Come on board at once.”</p>

<p>A little surprised at this greeting, I climbed
up the ladder and was received by a midshipman,
who conducted me at once to the captain’s
quarters.</p>

<p>That officer sat at one side of a long table,
and a sub-lieutenant, who was evidently acting
as his secretary, sat at the other. Saluting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
commander, I presented the note I had brought,
and stood there waiting for the reply which I
supposed would soon be given. Slowly the captain
opened and read the note, and then glancing
up at me, he asked curtly:</p>

<p>“Your name?”</p>

<p>“Arthur Dunn.”</p>

<p>“You are from Massachusetts Colony?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Your age?”</p>

<p>“Nearly seventeen, sir.”</p>

<p>“You have put down these facts?” he inquired
now of the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you have rated him as an apprentice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he remarked, and then turned
to me, saying to my astonishment:</p>

<p>“There you are, Master Dunn, duly shipped
on His Majesty’s frigate, <i>St. George</i>, and we
hope to hear good things of you.” Then to the
midshipman, who had shown me to the cabin
and who had all this time been waiting, he said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
“Take him forward, Midshipman Seymour, and
see that he is furnished with the usual outfit.”</p>

<p>By this time I had recovered sufficiently from
my astonishment to protest:</p>

<p>“But, sir, I did not come here to ship on the
frigate. I came simply as Captain Weston’s
messenger.”</p>

<p>A look of surprise passed over the face of the
captain as he glanced again at the missive I had
brought.</p>

<p>“You admit you are Arthur Dunn,” he then
said, “and there can be no mistake. Yesterday
Captain Weston made full arrangements to
place you as an apprentice on board of this frigate.
This note says he has sent you here for
that purpose. We will have no further words
about it. Master Seymour, take him forward
as I have directed.”</p>

<p>I knew there was no appeal from this decision,
and sick at heart at this new and dastardly
trick of my enemy, I turned and followed my
conductor to the deck.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>AN UNFORTUNATE REMARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was perhaps natural that as I followed Midshipman
Seymour from the cabin I should try
to think of some way by which I might release
myself from the unhappy situation in which I
was now placed. But before I reached the deck
I had concluded there was little hope of any attempt
on my part proving successful.</p>

<p>I knew there was no appeal from the decision
of the captain of the frigate. His word was law
not only on board of his vessel, but in the port,
on all matters that pertained to the government
of his men. Even the consul would hardly dare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
to interfere in any matter that had arisen between
him and one of his crew. The best he
could do would be to report the affair to the
home government, and months might elapse before
it was considered, with a likelihood of its
being summarily dismissed as of too trifling a
character to claim the attention of the commissioners.
A friendless American lad would stand
little show in a contest with a British naval
commander.</p>

<p>To escape from the ship at that time by my
own efforts was also out of the question. The
ship was already in motion. That meant my
own yawl had been sent away and so I was not
surprised to behold it more than half way over
to the brig when I emerged into the open air.
But had it still been there by the ship’s side, it
would have been of no service to me. Admitted
I could have evaded the officer who had charge
of me and reached the boat, to return to the
<i>Young Phoenix</i> in it would only have been placing
myself again in Captain Weston’s power,
while to make for the shore would have precipitated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
a pursuit in which not only all the boats
of the frigate, but every vessel near enough
to read her signal, would have speedily engaged.
Furthermore, to attempt to escape and fail
would be to subject myself to the ill-will of both
officers and crew, and render my position on
the frigate infinitely more uncomfortable than I
cared even to think of. No one loves a runaway.
So with the best grace I could muster I followed
my conductor amidships, where I was
speedily given a sailor’s outfit; then I was taken
forward and assigned a berth.</p>

<p>“You belong to the main truck crew, and are
in the fourth watch,” Master Seymour now announced.
“Put on your rig, and go to your
place at once,” and then he left me.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes I had donned my uniform,
stowed away my extra traps, and was ready for
the deck. As I came out of the forecastle, an
officer stepped towards me, possibly to point out
my station, but I surprised him and my station-master
by walking over to my place without
guidance, and by the looks the latter gave each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
other, I knew I had made a favorable impression
on them.</p>

<p>The frigate, under full canvas, and with a
piping breeze from the north, was making
straight out to sea. And if I do say it, she made
a pretty sight. There is to my mind nothing
much handsomer than a fine ship with all her
sails set to a favorable breeze; and I could not
help a thrill of delight as I took in the scene.</p>

<p>Yet how strange it seemed to me to be a part
of it! An hour before there had not been the
slightest thought on my part that I should ever
enter His Majesty’s navy. But here I was,
wearing the royal uniform, duly entered on the
frigate’s roster, and starting out on a cruise
whose destination I did not even know. It might
be a return to the colonies, or a voyage to the
far east. This did not much concern me. The
things which rankled me most were that I was
there against my will, and that in an instant
I had been thrust out of the cabin and back to
the forecastle, which latter fact was especially
galling to my pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>My thoughts were rudely interrupted, however,
by a direct order from Midshipman Seymour.
The main sky sail had in some way
loosened and wound around its yard, marring
the beauty and the symmetry of the ship’s rig.
Noticing it as he was passing me, the young
officer called out:</p>

<p>“Here, Dunn, hurry aloft there and straighten
out that sail.”</p>

<p>I think he called me purposely to test the mettle
in me, but I was equal to the feat.</p>

<p>“Aye! aye! sir,” I answered, and, springing
to the nearest ladder, I ran up the mast without
hesitation or fear. In another minute I was astride
the yard, and deftly releasing the canvas,
I tautened it to its place, returning to the deck
amid the cheers of my station mates.</p>

<p>We were now outside of the great reef over
which I had come in the brig two nights before,
and our pilot was preparing to leave us. I had
some time before noticed that he was the same
man who had boarded the <i>Young Phoenix</i> the
night of the storm, but had thought little of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
fact. Pilots come and go continually, and it
was no more strange that he should be hired to
take the frigate out than that he had been secured
to take the brig into the harbor. But the
cheers of the sailors attracted his attention, and
he glanced towards me as I swung off the ratlines
to the deck. He stared at me for a moment
as though he could scarcely believe his eyes, and
then he turned to the officer of the deck, and
said something to him in his native tongue. The
lieutenant replied in the same language, and
then with their eyes upon me they engaged in
an earnest conversation for a few minutes.
Little knowing how much it was to effect my
future, I went back to my station.</p>

<p>Once out of the harbor, the bow of the frigate
was turned towards the south, and, somewhat
anxious to know whither we were bound, I
turned to one of my mates, an old tar who had
started the cheering which had greeted me on
my return from the maintopmast, asking:</p>

<p>“Say, mate, can you tell me what cruise we
are on?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>He shook his head. “They don’t let the likes
of us know,” he explained. “We may be goin’
to the South Pole for all Pete Berry knows.
Say, youngster, who be ye? Ye’ve seen a ship
afore, and know a bowline from a rudder, that’s
sartain.”</p>

<p>Thanking the old sailor for his compliment,
without explaining how I came to be on the frigate,
I told who I was, and the main facts of my
sea-faring life.</p>

<p>“So yer name is Dunn,” he commented when
I was through, “an’ ye’re no greenhorn. I’m
glad o’ that. We’ve got more’n sixty aboard
now, an’ don’t need another.”</p>

<p>The disgust of the old salt as he announced
this fact amused me and we were soon chatting
away like old chums. We talked of the ship, of
her rigging, and of her sailing qualities. Inadvertently
during our conversation I alluded to
a few changes that I would make in the adjusting
of her canvas to bring out her best speed,
and with a quick discernment Pete asked:</p>

<p>“Have ye ever ben in the cabin, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Yes, as mate,” I assented, my downfall coming
vividly before me.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” he remarked curiously; “an’
wonder what ye’re doin’ here.”</p>

<p>Before I could reply we were piped to rations,
and I was saved from appearing rude by not
answering him. The rest of the day was passed
in the usual routine of a man-of-war, and by
night I had become sufficiently familiar with my
duties to perform them as readily and handily
as any of my mates. My deftness was no longer
a surprise to them, however, for Pete had
quickly circulated not only the facts of my sea
experience, but the additional fact that I had
been an officer on the brig I had just left—though
this was a shrewd guess on his part, for
I had not mentioned the vessel on which I had
served as mate. Greatly amazed that I should
leave such a berth to enlist on the frigate as an
apprentice, they became certain there was a
mystery connected with the incident, which my
good luck the following day partially explained.</p>

<p>It came just after our morning rations had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
been issued. A midshipman came forward, and,
calling me by name, said I was wanted at once
in the cabin. Surprised at this summons I
obeyed, and was ushered into the presence of
the Captain, who sat in the same place at the
same table, with the same sub-lieutenant opposite
him as when I was there before.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Master Dunn,” was his
greeting, and he spoke with a heartiness I had
not expected.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” I replied politely.</p>

<p>“You were mate on the brig <i>Young Phoenix</i>?”
he then asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, second mate,” I admitted, wondering
what was coming.</p>

<p>“Did Captain Weston abandon you when the
vessel was off the great reef during the night
of our recent storm?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I assented, querying with myself
how he could have learned of the fact.</p>

<p>“Then you are that young officer who brought
the abandoned craft over the reef at flood tide,
and sailed her safely into the harbor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, young man, such a thing has
only been done once before, and that was ten
years ago? Why, the whole town is talking
about it!”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I didn’t know it,” I declared.
“There was nothing about the feat for them to
be amazed over. Anyone left on the brig would
have done just as I did.”</p>

<p>He shook his head in dissent, and then continued:</p>

<p>“Tell me how you had offended your Captain
so as to lead him to so far forget his conduct as
an officer as to desert you in a time of danger.”</p>

<p>I told him briefly the reason for Captain
Weston’s wrath.</p>

<p>“I won’t attempt to justify you here for disobeying
the command of a superior officer, even
if he was clearly in the wrong. Sometimes it is
not a safe thing to do. Of two evils you must
choose the least, letting another be responsible
for his own mistake,” he remarked with a smile,
when I was done. “But I now understand what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
you meant yesterday morning by protesting
you had not come over to the ship with any intention
of enlisting. The whole thing was a
dastardly trick on the part of your captain
which he played partly that he might gratify
his feeling of resentment towards you, but more
because he dare not face his owners with the
report that you had saved a vessel which he had
himself abandoned. With you out of the way
he can make any report he pleases.”</p>

<p>This was a new view of the matter to me, but
I could readily see now it might have been the
chief cause of Captain Weston’s action, so I
nodded my head in token of the fact that I accepted
his explanation. Then the commander
continued:</p>

<p>“It must have seemed hard to you to be
thrust in an instant out of the cabin into the
forecastle.”</p>

<p>“It did, sir!”</p>

<p>“Yet you made no fuss.”</p>

<p>“What good would that have done, sir?” I
queried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>He laughed and was silent for a moment, then
said: “Tell me, what experience have you had
at sea?”</p>

<p>I told him, and then he began to ply me with
questions about the frigate, about her sails, and
her lines; how to handle her in emergencies;
and gave repeated orders, telling me to explain
them. There was nothing, however, I did not
understand, and rapidly as he put the questions,
I as rapidly answered them.</p>

<p>“Very good, Master Dunn,” he finally remarked.
“We have no midshipman on board
who could have passed a better examination.
Unfortunately it is too late for me to send you
back to the brig—and perhaps that would not
be the wisest thing to do. But it is not too late
for me to do you what justice I can.” Then
turning to his secretary, “Take the name of
Arthur Dunn from the list of apprentices, and
place it upon the list of midshipmen, dating the
fact from yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I have done so,” the lieutenant announced
a moment later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Very well; go now and call Midshipman Seymour.”</p>

<p>He obeyed, and soon returned with the young
officer.</p>

<p>“Midshipman Seymour,” the Captain began
sternly, “did you understand me to say yesterday
that this young man was rated as an apprentice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he stammered, glancing apprehensively
at me.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, someone has made a mistake.
Mark! I do not say it was you. It may have
been myself. But it was a mistake, and must
be rectified at once, sir. He is a midshipman,
and I want you to rectify the mistake immediately.
See that he is given a midshipman’s outfit,
and assigned to your own mess at once. Explain
to your brother officers that there was a
mistake—for which Master Dunn himself is in
no way accountable—by which he was sent to
the forecastle and he has proved he has the first
characteristic of a good officer—he can obey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
without a murmur or complaint. Good morning,
sir.”</p>

<p>“But let me thank you, sir, for this kindness,”
I began. But he interrupted me:</p>

<p>“It is simply justice, sir, and no man should
be thanked for doing right. Good morning.”</p>

<p>So for the second time within twenty-four
hours I followed Midshipman Seymour from the
cabin, but with what different feelings in my
heart! The first time I was filled with bitterness
and wrath, and almost ready to curse my
fate; this time I was overflowing with gratitude
and could even have thanked Captain Weston
for his base act had he been there.</p>

<p>I shall not weary you with the details of my
life on the frigate. I have no complaint to make
of the way I was treated. My relations with my
brother officers were for the most part very
pleasant, and as I now look back to that time I
in no way regret the ten months I was with
them. Our cruise was up the Mediterranean,
and the calls we made at the different ports
enabled me to become familiar with a portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
of the world I had long wanted to see. But the
greatest value of those months was the naval
training I received. Though I knew it not, a
Divine Providence was in that way fitting me
for my future career. But I am anticipating.</p>

<p>In August, 1775, we reached Egypt, and after
a brief stop at Alexandria, turned our prow to
the west. “Homeward bound!” my mates declared.
Homeward bound for them, but not for
me. London, which we reached in September,
was as much a foreign place to me as any we
had visited. Still I never tired of its sights, and
as often as possible I obtained shore leave that
I might wander through its streets, gaze upon
its churches, and visit its famous old Tower.</p>

<p>One day as I was going through Cheapside, on
my way to Newgate Street, I noticed a crowd
gathered around a man in the uniform of a British
army officer, who was haranguing them in
excited tones. Curious to hear what he was
saying, I went over to them. What was my
astonishment to find he was telling them of a
great battle which had taken place at Bunker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Hill, Boston, in the previous June! With bitter
invective he denounced the colonists, and declared
that His Majesty would soon send troops
enough over there to wipe the rebels off from
the face of the earth. Then he continued:</p>

<p>“And that is why, good people, I am here.
As a recruiting officer for the King I now offer
you the shilling. Who will walk up, and taking
it in his palm, enter His Majesty’s service?
Here is a shilling for each one who is ready to
cross the seas and avenge the comrades who
have been slain by the rebels! Walk right up,
my friends!”</p>

<p>Then catching sight of me standing there in
my naval uniform, he called out:</p>

<p>“There is the kind of young men I am looking
for! Do you notice how fine he looks in his rig?
I dare say he will soon be sailing across the
ocean to fight for his King. Won’t you, my
lad?”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“What I want is a second mate.”</p>

<p class="right">(p. <a href="#second">18</a>)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But I was already heated to the boiling point
by the tidings I had heard, and, blazing with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>indignation that he should dare ask me, a loyal
colonist, such a question, I blurted out:</p>

<p>“I’ll see His Majesty hung first! Do you
think I’ll fight against my native country?”</p>

<p>“A rebel! A rebel! Right here among us!
Seize him, comrades! Don’t let him escape!
His Majesty knows what to do with such fellows.
Seize him!” and he sprang towards me.</p>

<p>“Here he is, sir!” cried a stout teamster by
my side, and he reached out his hand to hold me.
But I eluded his grasp, and, turning, darted
back down the street, with the whole crowd at
my heels.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>IN WHICH I HAVE MY FIRST TASTE OF A BRITISH
PRISON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Around the first corner and down to Watling
Street I ran, taking the nearest course to the
river, though I had no intention of returning
to my ship. The startling news I had heard
about the state of affairs in the homeland had
fired me with a patriotism before which all
thought of allegiance to the King vanished. I
was inflamed with the desire to cross the ocean
at once and throw in my lot with my struggling
countrymen. For the present I would endeavor
to escape my pursuers; later I would find some
way to return to my native land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>I came to this decision in the brief time it
took me to reach St. Paul’s church. Turning
there, I crossed Carter Lane and Queen Street,
and came out upon the Thames near St. Paul’s
pier. Here a glance behind me showed that I
had distanced my pursuers. Noting this fact
with much satisfaction, I sped out upon the
wharf and darted through the open door of the
nearest warehouse. No one appeared to dispute
my entrance or to check my advance, and
swiftly I glided between the barrels and boxes
to the farthest side of the room. Here I found
another door. It was closed but unfastened, and
I had time to open it before the angry mob that
was following me appeared. Passing quickly
into the next apartment, I shut the door and
rolled a huge cask of rum against it, effectually
barring it. Confident now that it would be some
time before my pursuers discovered my whereabouts,
I proceeded leisurely through the semi-darkness
of the room to a place where great
bales of cotton were piled nearly to the ceiling.
Among these I at length found an open space<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
which allowed me to crawl back of the outer
tier, where I lay down and waited.</p>

<p>So still was the immense building I could
plainly hear the pursuing men enter the other
apartment in search of me. The persistence
with which they kept at their task told of their
eagerness to find me. At length two of them
tried the door of the room in which I was hiding,
and, on discovering it was barred, one of them
exclaimed confidently:</p>

<p>“He cannot have gone in there!”</p>

<p>“Where is he then?” asked the other doubtingly.
“I certainly saw him enter here. Where
can he have gone?”</p>

<p>“Out of that open scuttle in the roof,” answered
the first.</p>

<p>“But it is more than four and twenty feet
to the ground,” objected the second.</p>

<p>“What of that?” retorted his companion
scornfully. “He’s a sailor and can climb up or
down these walls as easily as he would a mast.
It’s just as I told you, while we have been looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
for him among these boxes and barrels, he
has made good his escape.”</p>

<p>The objector seemed to be convinced, for
without another word he followed his comrade
down the room. The sound of their footsteps
grew fainter and fainter, and finally ceased altogether.
Evidently the search for me had been
abandoned. Still I did not stir. I was safely
hidden, and would remain where I was until the
hour for closing the warehouse had come.</p>

<p>Opposite the opening through which I had
crawled was an outside door, one edge of which
was warped enough to allow a few rays of light
to enter. I watched these, knowing that when
they disappeared it would be time for me to
make a move.</p>

<p>How slowly the minutes passed! What a
tumult of thoughts crowded through my brain!
The events since I had left the colony came
trooping in rapid succession. The life on board
the frigate was lived over again. With these
bygone experiences came plans for the future.
I knew there were several vessels in the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
hailing from American ports. Once let their
captains know of the battle at Bunker Hill and
they would hasten to sail for home. Doubtless
on one of these crafts I could find a berth. I
resolved therefore, to visit them in turn under
the cover of the night until I had secured a
place.</p>

<p>At length the light through the doorway grew
so faint as to be scarcely perceptible, and I
crawled out of my hole, and went over to the
entrance. First gently, and then more vigorously
I tried to open the door. My efforts were
useless, however, for it was fastened on the outside.
So I retraced my steps to the place where
I had entered, rolled the cask away from the
door, and opened it. Stepping through into the
next room, I turned to close the entrance after
me, when a voice startled me.</p>

<p>“So you were there after all, my young bantam,”
it exclaimed. “Tim Waters thought so.
You didn’t fool him, if you did the others; and
it has been worth while to wait for you too, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
now the five pounds offered for your capture
is mine.”</p>

<p>A glance showed me that the speaker was a
burly fellow, evidently the porter of the warehouse.
Doubtless he had known that the door
between the apartments of the building was not
fastened, and finding it secured, had quickly
divined that I was within. So, stimulated by
the reward offered for my apprehension, he
had patiently awaited my coming.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I surmised this fact when he
sprang forward to seize me. But quick as he
was, I was quicker, and, eluding his grasp,
dodged by him. So confident was he that he
was going to grab me, he had put his whole
force into his forward spring, and now, missing
me, he also lost his balance, and plunged headlong
against the door. Startled by his call, I
had but partly closed it, and, swinging back as
he came against it, he was precipitated into the
other room. The cask which I had used as a
barricade was only a few feet away, and striking
upon this with his head and shoulders on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
one side and his legs and feet upon the other,
he set it to rolling. I could scarcely refrain
from a shout of laughter as I saw him struggling
to regain his feet, and by his very efforts
sending his unwieldy steed farther and farther
down the room. Not until the barrel fetched
up against the pile of cotton bales did it stop,
and even then it was a moment or two before
he could regain an upright position. I only
waited long enough to notice he was not seriously
injured, and then shutting the door, I
fastened it on my side by passing a piece of a
box cover through the door handle.</p>

<p>In another minute I was in the open air, and
finding the way clear, I hastened through the
fast falling darkness to the street. Keeping in
the shadows as much as possible, I went down
the river bank to a point nearly opposite the
first American vessel. Here I undertook to
reach the end of an adjacent wharf, hoping
there to find a boat in which I could visit the
brig. But I had hardly got a dozen feet down
the planking before a watchman confronted me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
saying gruffly as he tried to look me over in
the darkness:</p>

<p>“Who are you? What do you want here?
Are you that rebel midshipman I have been told
to look out for? Faith, I believe you are!”
and he seized me by the collar before I could do
a thing to prevent him.</p>

<p>Then began a struggle which lasted for some
minutes. We were about equally matched in
strength, but he had me at a disadvantage and
I am quite sure would have at length mastered
me but for an accident. Coming to a place where
the flooring suddenly raised itself a few inches,
he stumbled and fell full length upon his back.
I was pulled down upon him, but he lost his
hold upon me, and before he could recover it,
I regained my feet and was away.</p>

<p>I had no trouble in eluding him, or those he
aroused by his cries, but as I made off under
the friendly cover of the night I must confess
my heart was filled with apprehension. It was
very evident that the whole water front had
been guarded against every attempt on my part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
to board a ship from the colonies. The offer of
a reward for my arrest had, moreover, put all
the watchmen on the alert. If I escaped, therefore,
two things were clear: I must change
my naval garb for one less conspicuous, and
I must make off across the country to some
other port. Having come to this conclusion, I
left the river, and started towards the rear end
of the town. After going a mile or more the
lights of a second-hand clothing shop attracted
me. Crossing the street, I glanced in at the window.
The store was evidently kept by an old
Jew who was alone, and I ventured in.</p>

<p>“Have you a second-hand rig you would exchange
for this I have on?” I briefly asked.</p>

<p>He glanced curiously at me, and then with a
shrewd look in his eyes remarked:</p>

<p>“Running away from your ship, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I admitted promptly, “but I am willing
to give you a good bargain, so what does
that matter to you?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “It might get me into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
trouble with the naval authorities,” he replied.
“It’s risky business.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how,” I retorted. “You can tell
them I claimed to have surrendered my commission,
or anything else you choose. They
cannot blame you for making a good trade when
you had the chance.”</p>

<p>He came slowly around his counter and
looked my uniform carefully over. It was
nearly new, and in excellent condition, and as
he noted these facts the look in his eyes changed
to one of greed.</p>

<p>“It’s risky, risky,” he replied, “and I can’t
allow you much for the garments. But here
is something I will give you for it,” and he led
the way to the other side of the shop. From a
shelf he took what had evidently been the suit
of a farmer lad. It was of coarse material and
well worn, yet neat and clean.</p>

<p>“I took this a week ago from a youngster
who ran away to sea,” he explained; “now I’ll
exchange with you to help you run away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the sea,” and he laughed at his attempt at facetiousness.</p>

<p>The clothes were not worth half those I was
wearing, but I did not hesitate.</p>

<p>“I will do it,” I said. “Can I go into your
back room and make the change?”</p>

<p>He assented, and led me into the rear room,
leaving me alone, as another customer came in
just then. I took the opportunity, while changing
my clothing, to look over the state of my
finances, finding I had five shillings and a sixpence.
There was little likelihood of my earning
any more and this sum, therefore, must last
me until I could find a ship for home. So it was
clear that whatever port I decided to go to, I
must walk, in order to husband my little store.</p>

<p>My first anxiety, however, was to put the city
behind me, and with this end in view, upon leaving
the shop I struck off uptown at a brisk rate.
An hour later, in the outskirts, I stopped at an
inn long enough to get supper, and then resumed
my tramp. All night long I kept it up,
but as dawn came on, finding myself near a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
small village, which I afterwards learned to be
Watford, I entered and made my way to its one
tavern. There I secured a room, to which I at
once retired for a much needed rest. Some
hours later I was awakened by the inn-keeper,
whom I found sitting down on the side of my
bed gazing long and fixedly at me.</p>

<p>“There is a squad of soldiers down stairs
who are looking for a lad about your size and
build, I should judge.”</p>

<p>Though greatly alarmed by the tidings, there
was something in the man’s gaze which reassured
me, and I waited for him to go on:</p>

<p>“They say he is a young rebel from the colonies,
who has cursed the King.”</p>

<p>Still I was silent.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it,” he continued. “You
have a friend in me.”</p>

<p>The man’s dealing with me proved that, so
I frankly told my story.</p>

<p>“If that is all, I will protect you,” he declared.
“I have a brother over there, and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
sympathies are with the colonies. I hope they
will win,” and he abruptly left the room.</p>

<p>Listening at the door, I heard him descend
the stairs, and say to the officer in charge of
the troopers:</p>

<p>“I have no one here dressed as you say that
young rebel was; but I’ll tell you what I’ll do.
If he comes this way, I’ll take care of him,” a
promise he literally kept. For he not only
boarded me a week, long enough, as he believed,
to end all search for me, but on my departure
put money enough into my hands to pay my
fare by stage to Liverpool, where he advised
me to go.</p>

<p>“You may regard all I have done for you as
a loan,” were his parting words, “and repay
me when I come to America,” a thing I am glad
to say I was able to do.</p>

<p>I left Watford with little fear of detection,
and enjoyed to the full my ride across the country
to St. Helen’s, a small town a few miles
out of Liverpool. The stage reached there just
at dark, and, as I had done a half dozen times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
before, I descended from its top and entered
the tavern to order supper and a room for the
night. Two feet over the threshold a hand was
laid upon my shoulder and a voice I instantly
recognized said:</p>

<p><a id="prisoner"></a>“Master Dunn, you are my prisoner.” It was
the recruiting sergeant whom I had heard in
Cheapside, London, telling of the war with the
colonies.</p>

<p>Resistance was useless, for behind the officer
stood four soldiers with their muskets ready for
instant use, so I submitted to my arrest with
the best grace I could muster.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they mounted me upon a
horse, surrounded me with a squad of troopers,
and hurried me off towards Liverpool. Reaching
the city, they hastened along its narrow
streets to a huge stone building on the river’s
edge before which they stopped. Tumbling me
unceremoniously from the beast I rode, they led
me through the heavy portals, and along the
dark corridors to a room in the rear, into which
they thrust me and swung to its stout door with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
a clang that still echoes in my ears. I did not
need to be told where I was—the structure, its
form, its appearance, its interior arrangements,
spoke louder than human words. It said in a
silent but unmistakable language, “You are in
a British prison.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>I MEET A NEW FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I will not attempt to describe my feelings as
I stood there in the darkness, with those stout
walls shutting me from the liberty I craved—craved
that I might give myself to the service
of my struggling country. I am quite sure I
could not at that time separate the mingled feelings
of chagrin, regret, and hopelessness that
oppressed me. One word alone can express the
condition of my mind and heart just then—despair.
I could have shed tears if it would
have been of any use; it may be a sob did escape
me, but if so it was speedily checked, for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
heavy voice spoke from the farthest corner of
the room, demanding:</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>I had supposed I was alone in the cell. Surprised
now to find I was sharing it with another,
I nevertheless was able to answer promptly:</p>

<p>“An unfortunate prisoner like yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the response, “but I mean are
you British or American?” and I thought I detected
an eagerness, almost a suspense in the
speaker’s voice as he waited for an answer.</p>

<p>“American,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Thank God for that!” was the immediate
ejaculation. Then I heard a sound as though
one was rising from a bed, and the next instant
the man came over where I was with rapid
strides.</p>

<p>“I am Samuel Tucker, a sea captain from
Marblehead, in the colony of Massachusetts,”
he announced much to my astonishment. “Now
tell me who are you?”</p>

<p>“Captain Tucker!” I cried, ignoring his
question in my surprise and joy. “Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Samuel Tucker of Marblehead, and I came
across the ocean to find you! Who would have
thought we should meet here—in a cell of the
Liverpool jail!”</p>

<p>“‘Came across the ocean to find me,’” he
repeated, and I could not help noticing the wonderment
in his tones. “Pray tell me then who
are you?”</p>

<p>“I am Arthur Dunn, the son of Captain
Dunn, with whom you once sailed,” I replied,
and then rapidly, yet in fullest detail, I told my
story, beginning with my mother’s dying request,
and ending with my arrest an hour or
two before.</p>

<p>“So you are in jail for the very same reason
I am,” he remarked with a slight laugh when
I was done. Then he spun his own yarn.</p>

<p>He had made a quick voyage to Lisbon, discharged
his cargo, taken another, and returned
to the colony. Then he had sailed for Marseilles,
France. There an agent of the English
government had come to him, desiring to charter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
his brig to go over to Gibraltar and convey
a company of soldiers to Liverpool.</p>

<p>“The rascal never told me why the regiment
was hurrying home,” the Captain explained,
“or I would not have let him have my craft at
any price. But the pay was good, and I fell
into the same trap that a half dozen other
Yankee skippers did. We went to Gibraltar
and brought in here a regiment which sailed the
very next day after its arrival for the colonies
to fight our countrymen. When I learned the
truth my blood boiled within me, and I cursed
the King and his government to the agent’s
face when he came to pay me the charter
money. I might have known what would follow;
the confiscation of my vessel and my incarceration
here. But the fellow knew just what
I thought of him and the government,” he concluded
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“How long have you been in here?” I now
asked.</p>

<p>“Two weeks,” he responded; “but come over
here,” he added in a low whisper, and, taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
me by the arm, he led me down the cell to its
one narrow window, through which so little
light came that I had not noticed it until then.</p>

<p>Once at the aperture he raised my hands with
his own to the window frame, and then I became
aware that he was removing it. Placing it
noiselessly on the floor, he carried my hand up
to the iron grating, which I soon found he was
taking down bar by bar.</p>

<p>“There,” he said at length in a tone so low
I could scarcely hear him, “you see the way is
clear for our escape. This is why I was so
anxious to find out if you were an American. I
wanted no one here to thwart my plans. We
shall go at midnight, so you will not be long
within these walls, Master Dunn,” and again
he chuckled.</p>

<p>“But is not the river outside this wall?” I
questioned, “and some feet below? How are
we to get down to it?”</p>

<p>“With this,” he replied, and carrying my
hand up to his bosom I felt hidden inside of his
shirt a coil of stout rope. “Oh! the preparations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
are all made, and cannot fail,” he continued
confidently. “A boat from a Yankee ship
in the river will come under this window at midnight,
and lowering ourselves into that, we shall
be taken off to the vessel which will sail before
daylight. The only change in the plan is she
will carry two passengers instead of one. You
see, you came just in time to go home with me,
Master Dunn.”</p>

<p>The confidence in his own tones inspired me.
A half-hour before I had been on the verge of
despair; now I was nearly wild in my exuberance
of joy. I could scarcely wait for the hour
to come when we should leave our cell. Then
I fell to wondering how Captain Tucker had
been able to arrange so completely his plan of
escape and as though he divined my thought,
the captain told me, while we waited the coming
of the rescuing yawl.</p>

<p>“Anchored in the harbor, near my own brig,
at the time of my arrest,” he began, “was the
ship <i>Rebecca Morris</i> from Philadelphia. Her
captain is an old friend of mine, and I knew if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
I could manage to communicate with him he
would do all in his power to help me escape.
Under the pretext of sending a message to my
family in the colonies I asked the turnkey who
came to my cell daily to take a letter off to Captain
Allen. At first the fellow, demurred, but
when I offered him my watch, a valuable one, in
return for the favor, and let him see the note I
had written, he yielded. Unbeknown to him,
however, I substituted a second note for the first
one, in which I described the situation of my
cell, and suggested a way in which my friend
could aid me. That night a boat came under
my window, bringing the things I had asked
for—a file and a stout rope. Meanwhile I removed
the sash with my pocket knife, and unraveled
one of my stockings to obtain the string
I needed. With the latter I pulled up a stouter
cord, and then the file and the rope from the
yawl. I knew it would take me several days to
cut through the bars, and so sent down a note
requesting the boat to return here for me tonight.
When the cord came back, there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
line from Captain Allen himself assuring me
he would be here without fail.”</p>

<p>As the moments passed I could not help
growing anxious lest for some reason the
friendly captain should fail us. On the other
hand, Captain Tucker was as cool and undisturbed
as it was possible for a man to be.</p>

<p>“I know Christopher Allen,” he declared
again and again, “and he will be here as sure
as the sun will rise tomorrow morning. All the
guards on the river cannot stop him. He’ll find
a way to outwit them and rescue us.”</p>

<p>At length there came the yowl of a cat from
somewhere on the river. Captain Tucker
leaped to his feet (for we had been sitting on
the edge of the bed while we waited), exclaiming
in a suppressed whisper:</p>

<p>“What did I tell you, Master Dunn? He is
almost here.”</p>

<p>Again the yowl sounded nearer, and as
though the animal was floating on the tide down
by the jail. Then it came the third time directly
under our window-sill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>My companion had already drawn the coil
of rope from his bosom, and was making one
end fast to a piece of the iron grating. Placing
this across the narrow aperture, he threw out
the cord, and turned to me, saying:</p>

<p>“All is ready, Master Dunn, and you shall
go first. Tell Captain Allen, however, that I’m
right behind you.”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir,” I remonstrated, “you should go
first, as the plan is yours and—” but I did not
finish.</p>

<p>“I am in command here,” he interrupted
with an authority I could not dispute, “and
you are to go now.”</p>

<p>With the words he lifted me in his brawny
arms and thrust me feet foremost through the
opening. I caught the rope in my hands and
in another moment was gliding swiftly down
it. The distance was not so great as I had expected,
and it seemed but an instant before
stout hands seized me and set me gently down
in the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“You are not Captain Tucker,” a voice then
whispered in my ear.</p>

<p>“No,” I admitted in the same low tone, “I
am Arthur Dunn, a fellow prisoner whom Captain
Tucker insisted should come down first.
He is right behind me.”</p>

<p>The swaying of the rope confirmed my words,
and, pushing me to one side, the same brawny
arms caught the captain as he came down. The
next minute the light craft darted off down the
river as swiftly as four oars could pull it.</p>

<p>I had been given a place in the bow, while
Captain Tucker sat with Captain Allen in the
stern of the boat. What passed between them
on our way to the ship I never knew, but when
we were in her cabin her skipper turned to me,
and putting his hand in mine, said:</p>

<p>“I have had a double pleasure tonight, Master
Dunn. Instead of plucking one patriot out
of the hands of the enemy, I have taken two.
I knew your father. I believe he has in you a
son worthy of him. You are welcome to a place
among us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>I thanked him as best I could, and went to the
berth assigned me with a heart full of gratitude
to the overruling Providence that had so wonderfully
cared for me and given me such kind
friends.</p>

<p>But I was destined to find a more powerful
friend before that voyage was finished. This
was Master Robert Morris, the owner of the
vessel, and a member of the Continental Congress,
who was on board as a passenger. Either
Captain Tucker or Captain Allen must have
told him who I was and how I came to be on
board the ship, for when I went on deck the next
morning, he came up to me, and having congratulated
me on my escape from the British
prison, said with a smile:</p>

<p>“We ought to hear good things from you and
Captain Tucker. You both have early shown
that you are loyal to the colonies.”</p>

<p>Having no desire to be a drone on the vessel,
I went to the captain after breakfast and
offered my services in any place he could use
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“It is commendable in you, Master Dunn, to
make this offer,” he replied, “and I will say
I rather expected it of you. It is your father
all over again. But there is no place I can put
you except with the sailors. Captain Tucker
has already made a similar offer, and I can
hardly put the best skipper that ever sailed out
of a New England port out of the cabin, so I
have created the berth of a third mate in order
to use him. You can hardly expect me to arrange
for a fourth mate much as I should like
to keep you with us. But if you care to go to
the forecastle, I will enter you on the ship’s
roster as an able seaman.”</p>

<p>“I had rather go there than be idle,” I
answered promptly, and, having been assigned
my watch and station, I went forward. Though
I did not know it then, my act greatly pleased
Master Morris, who was already furtively
watching both Captain Tucker and myself for
proofs of our seamanship.</p>

<p>Before the voyage was over he had the opportunity
to see us in positions which tested to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
full our qualities as sailors, for ere a week had
passed we encountered one of the severest gales
I ever experienced. For three days it raged,
carrying away our shrouds and yards as if they
were tow, racking the ship until her seams
opened, and she was in great jeopardy. What
was even worse, the Captain was stricken down
by a falling spar, and both of his limbs were
broken.</p>

<p>In this emergency Captain Tucker stepped
forward and offered to take charge of the vessel.
To this Master Morris and the mates readily
assented. The new commander’s first act
was to assign me to his own position as third
mate, and his second to assure the men he
would save the vessel, if they would only
promptly obey his orders. Then he went to the
wheel, and, taking the helm into his own hands,
guided the ship all that night through the storm.</p>

<p>His orders, issued from the wheel, were
promptly executed by the sailors who had taken
on new courage and when dawn came and the
tempest abated, there was not a single soul on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
board but what was ready to own that it was to
his skill and knowledge the ship and the crew
owed their preservation.</p>

<p>This deed was the link in the chain that secured
the fast friendship of Master Morris.
Grateful for the saving of his vessel, upon our
arrival in port, he introduced Captain Tucker
to some of the other members of the Continental
Congress, and before he left Philadelphia for
home he had the promise of a captain’s commission
in the Continental Navy.</p>

<p>Nor was I forgotten. Master Morris spoke
a kind word for me, and I was assured that I
should have a midshipman’s commission in return
for the one I had lost.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>OUR FIRST PRIZE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Our arrival in Marblehead created quite a
sensation. Tidings of Captain Tucker’s imprisonment
and the confiscation of his vessel
had already reached there, while his escape was
unknown. His sudden appearance in the streets
of the village therefore brought him almost an
ovation, and men, women, and even the children
crowded around him, hoping to hear how he
had escaped the enemy’s hands.</p>

<p>A few of the townspeople remembered my
visit to the place several months before in
search of the Captain, and when it became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
known that I had also been thrown into jail for
defying the King, I came in for my own share
of public attention; so for some days we both
knew what it was to be famous.</p>

<p>Then the excitement subsided, and we were
permitted to move among the people in a commonplace
sort of way, and unmolested to attend
to the daily tasks that fell to us. At the Captain’s
request I made my home with him while
we awaited our commissions, and, save for a
brief visit to my native village early in January,
I did not leave him.</p>

<p>It was January 20, (1776) when I returned
from my visit. As I had only a small bundle
with me, I left the stage at the door of the
tavern, and started to walk to the house I now
called my home. I had gone but a few yards
when I heard the clatter of a horse’s hoofs behind
me, and, turning, I saw a man in martial
costume and adorned with the trappings of
rank riding in hot haste towards me.</p>

<p>His coming had already aroused much
curiosity on the part of the villagers, for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
were gathering at the windows and on the
streets and wharves, to gaze at the trooper as
he galloped along. He dashed by me, and took
the nearest road to Captain Tucker’s residence
on Rowland Hill. Suspecting he was a messenger
from the Congressional Committee, I quickened
my steps and came in sight of the house
in time to witness an amusing scene.</p>

<p>Captain Tucker was out in the yard chopping
wood. The gaily decked officer rode up and dismounted.
Seeing a person dressed in ordinary
garb—a tarpaulin hat slouching over his face,
a pea jacket and red waistcoat covering his
body, brown breeches on his legs, and a flaming
bandanna waving about his neck—he, naturally
perhaps, thought he must have come to the
wrong place, and so called out roughly:</p>

<p>“I say, fellow, I wish you would tell me if the
Honorable Samuel Tucker lives hereabouts!”</p>

<p>“Honorable? Honorable?” questioned the
Captain with a shrewd look at the stranger.
“There is not any man of that name in Marblehead.
He must be one of the family of Tuckers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
in Salem. I am the only Samuel Tucker here.”</p>

<p>The trooper took his packet from his pocket,
looked at it again and again. “Lives in a house,
two stories, gable-end, standing by itself on a
hill, not far from the bay shore, a piece of
woods near it,” he read out slowly. “Surely
this must be the place,” he commented, looking
sharply around him; and then eying the chopper
from head to foot, he continued:</p>

<p>“Captain Glover at Cambridge told me that
he knew Master Tucker well, and that he lived
in Marblehead, and described his house for
me—‘gable-end, on the sea-side, none near it.’
Faith, this looks like the very place.”</p>

<p>The parley, however, soon came to an end,
for the messenger was not slow to notice the
gallant look and noble appearance of the man
before him, and knew he could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>“You yourself must be Captain Tucker,” he
declared, handing the packet to the man before
him, “and here is your commission as a Captain
in the Continental Navy. I also have a midshipman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
commission for Arthur Dunn. Can you
tell me where I may find him?”</p>

<p>“He’s right behind you, I reckon,” remarked
the captain, taking his packet and waiting for
me to take mine. Then he invited the stranger
to come into the house and take a rest and refreshments
before he returned to Cambridge—an
invitation which was gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>With the commissions were our assignments
to the frigate <i>Franklin</i>, carrying sixteen guns,
and stationed at Beverly. The Captain was also
directed to get her in readiness at once for a
cruise.</p>

<p>Busy days followed. The stores were
shipped, the ammunition was placed on board,
and in a week we would have been ready for
sea had our outfit of small arms arrived. After
three days delay Captain Tucker grew impatient,
and, going over to Salem, he purchased the
weapons with his own money and had them sent
on board. As he saw them arranged in their
racks, he turned to me, who had been directing
the work, and remarked with satisfaction:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“There! we’ll get off tomorrow morning,
Master Dunn.”</p>

<p>He went over to Marblehead that evening
and when he returned he carried a huge bundle
in his arms. To his executive officer, Lieutenant
Fettyplace, he explained:</p>

<p>“It’s a banner my wife has been making for
us. Tomorrow, before we sail, we’ll break it
out from the masthead.”</p>

<p>Naturally curious to see it, Master Fettyplace,
Lieutenant Salter, the second officer, and
myself, who stood near, waited for him to show
the flag to us. But he did not do it. It was not
until my own hands pulled the cord the next
morning which unfurled the banner from the
frigate’s peak that we saw the beautiful piece
which Mistress Tucker had wrought.</p>

<p>There it floated on the gentle breeze: a white
field, a green union, made in the form of a pine
tree, with the motto beneath it: “An appeal to
heaven.” And under that flag we fought until
Congress had adopted the stars and stripes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Ten minutes later with every foot of the
ship’s canvas stretched to the north-west wind,
we were standing out to sea. Once out of the
harbor, our bow was turned towards Cape Cod,
and a man was sent to the cross-trees to be on
the lookout for prizes. We found not one, but
two, much sooner than we expected. The circumstances
as near as I can recall were these:</p>

<p>Just before dark, hearing a loud cannonading
on our left, and apparently some distance away,
we directed our course thither. Before the night
fairly shut down, we came near enough to see
four vessels engaged in conflict. Two of these,
a ship and a brig, were flying the British flag,
while the other two were schooners, and clearly
American privateers.</p>

<p>Not wishing to take the English vessels from
those who had first discovered them, and who
had the first right to them as prizes if they
could capture them, we refrained from entering
into the engagement. But when the enemy beat
off our friends, and sailed away towards Boston,
we immediately gave chase. The Britishers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
and our own ship were evidently faster sailers
than the privateers, and soon we had left them
behind. At nine o’clock they were out of sight,
and the chase was all our own. Then the wind
nearly failed, and for an hour or two we drifted
along a mile behind our prey.</p>

<p>About this time our lookout reported another
sail some distance away off our starboard. It
was too dark to make her out, and Captain
Tucker immediately ordered out a boat, and
putting me in charge, directed me to go over
and reconnoitre the strange vessel.</p>

<p>“Take a dark lantern with you, Master
Dunn,” he said, “and, if she prove to be an
English cruiser, suspend your light near the
edge of the water as a signal of your immediate
return. We’ll be on the lookout for you. If,
however, she be an American vessel, then
elevate your light in the air, and we’ll come
down, pick you up, and speak with her.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” I responded, and descending
to the yawl, I gave the order to pull away.</p>

<p>When near enough for the sound of our oars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
to be detected, we muffled them, and cautiously
advanced, seeking to get under the stern of the
craft without being discovered. At length we
were near enough to discern through the darkness
that she was a trim schooner carrying ten
guns, and that her course showed she was trying
to overhaul the British vessels. This fact
made me a little suspicious of her character,
for it seemed to me a daring attempt for her
to be following up two vessels, each larger than
herself, with an idea of attacking them. I
called the attention of our boatswain, Joseph
Lewis, to this circumstance, asking in a low
tone:</p>

<p>“Does it not seem to you, Master Lewis, that
she must be a Britisher, a consort of the ship
and brig, and is endeavoring to overhaul
them?”</p>

<p>“Two things are agin that, sir,” he replied
in the same cautious way. “Fust, thar’s her
build. She came from Yankee stocks as sure as
my name is Joe Lewis. Then thar’s the flag she
carries. I can’t jest make it out, sir, but it ain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the English colors. As for her followin’ two
vessels larger than herself, that doesn’t signify.
We’ve got Capt’ns who’d do it with half her
guns, hopin’ to find a way to cut out one or
t’other of them. I’m sure, sir, we’ll find she’s
a friend. I’m ready to risk runnin’ right up
to her.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think we’ll do that,” I answered.
“But we’ll work up under her stern, and make
sure who she is.”</p>

<p>“I beg yer pardon, sir,” he continued, “but
if ye’ll order all the men to lie low in the boat,
an’ git down yerself, an’ let me have an oar,
I’ll scull her up under the schooner in no time
without their ’specting we’re thar.”</p>

<p>I gave the necessary command, and, stooping
as low as he possibly could and yet work an
oar, he sent our yawl noiselessly forward in the
wake of the stranger. Five minutes later he
touched my arm. I looked up and he made a
quick upward gesture. I understood, and
opened my dark lantern enough to send a single
ray of light on the stern of the schooner which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
was now just above our heads. With a thrill of
delight I read her name—<i>Katy</i>—and her port—Providence
in the Rhode Island Plantations.</p>

<p>Dropping behind her far enough to make it
safe to signal our frigate, we raised our light
high in the air with an oar, and waited. It was
not long, light as the breeze was, before the ship
was alongside of us, and, picking us up, she
went on after the schooner. In ten minutes we
spoke with her, and her captain, Abraham
Whipple, came on board.</p>

<p>Captain Tucker and he speedily came to an
agreement to join forces and attack the English
vessels, and since Captain Tucker held his commission
from the Continental Congress, it was
arranged that both of the Yankee crafts should
be under his command. These preliminaries
completed, we hastened on as fast as the light
wind would permit us after the enemy. It was
clear by their course that they were striving to
make Boston harbor; and equally clear after
an hour or two of watching that all four vessels
were about equally matched in speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>As we drew near Long Island clouds overcast
the dim stars, shutting out what light we had,
and we were uncertain whether the ships we
were pursuing took the east or west channel.
So Captain Tucker signalled the <i>Katy</i> to go up
the east side, while he went up the west side of
the island. It was our good fortune to speedily
overtake the transports which, running too close
to the flats, got aground.</p>

<p>Clearing away our guns, we ran abreast the
Britishers and poured in a broadside. They
both responded from their starboard batteries,
the only ones they could use. Our shots were
low and did great havoc among the troops and
crew of the enemy. On the other hand, their
guns were aimed too high and the balls passed
above our heads, riddling our sails and doing
much damage to our spars and rigging; then
they swept on, endangering the Rhode Island
schooner, which lay on the other side of the island,
becalmed, in range of the English cannon,
and unable to change her position or to render
us any assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>For a half-hour the battle raged until the
commander of the British ship was slain, when
she struck her colors, and her consort quickly
followed. I was with Lieutenant Fettyplace
when he boarded the larger craft, finding her to
be the <i>George</i>, from Glasgow, Scotland. Lieutenant
Salter went off to the brig, and reported
her to be the <i>Annabella</i> from the same Scottish
port. Each vessel carried a large cargo of ammunition,
clothing and stores for the British
army, while on the latter were two hundred and
fifty Highland soldiers, under command of
Colonel Archibald Campbell, and belonging to
General Frazer’s corps.</p>

<p>In the conflict we had not lost a man, nor had
any of the ship’s company been seriously
wounded. In short, our only damage was to
our sails and rigging. But the enemy had suffered
greatly. More than two score men were
more or less injured, while thirty-six, including
the captain of the <i>George</i>, lay dead.</p>

<p>One of the saddest sights I remember in all
my naval experience was that of the next day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
when we buried the dead Scotchmen on the
island. It was heartrending to see the women,
who had accompanied the troops, weeping with
loud lamentations, and to hear the bag-pipes
play the funeral dirge.</p>

<p>The hours before the sad burial had been
spent in floating the prizes, and transferring
our prisoners to the <i>Franklin</i>. A stiff breeze
from the south-west had enabled the <i>Katy</i> to rejoin
us. So the funeral once over, prize crews
were placed on the captured vessels, and we
sailed for Lynn.</p>

<p>There we turned them over to the Continental
agent, and had the satisfaction of knowing that
their cargoes—save one item—went to Washington’s
army at Cambridge. The exception was
the store of canvas we found among the prize
goods. This was used to furnish us with a new
set of sails, and we were soon off to sea again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>AN ASTONISHING OFFER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Our first voyage had been of three days duration,
and we had captured two prizes of considerable
value. Standing near Lieutenant Salter,
as we left the harbor for our second cruise,
I remarked:</p>

<p>“A short and successful trip was ours before,
Lieutenant Salter. What think you our fortune
will be this time, sir?”</p>

<p>He smiled. “Who can tell, Master Dunn?
This search for prizes is much like a lottery.
We may quickly make a fine draw, as we did
before, or we may get a blank. It’s even possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
that we may cruise around for weeks, yes,
this entire voyage, and yet return to port
empty-handed.”</p>

<p>“It’s not Captain Tucker’s luck to do that,”
I protested stoutly. “He’s always made successful
voyages, and I believe this will be no
exception. We shall not go many days before
we capture a craft. Remember what I tell
you.”</p>

<p>“I presume you would like to see them coming
so fast the Captain would find it hard work
to make up prize crews for them,” he responded
banteringly. Then he continued more earnestly:
“I agree with you. I believe Captain
Tucker sails under a lucky star, and have no
idea our trip is to be a fruitless one.”</p>

<p>He proved a true prophet. The very next
day we took a prize—a sloop from Halifax,
laden with dried fish, and bound for Boston.
Though not of great value, it was in no sense
to be despised, and to my own mind it was not
unimportant. It meant so much less food for
the enemy, and so much more for our brave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
troops. With this thought predominant I
raised a cheer as Boatswain Lewis, with a crew
of four men, started for port in charge of her—a
cheer which our entire ship’s company joined
in heartily.</p>

<p>Then the prizes followed in rapid succession
until we had nine to our credit, and our number
had been reduced three score to furnish
crews for them. Among these were several of
great value.</p>

<p>It was just two weeks since we left port when
we captured our tenth vessel, the brig <i>White
Swan</i>, from the Western Islands for Boston,
with a cargo of fruit and wine. I speak more
particularly of this, for my own personal fortunes
were more intimately connected with it.</p>

<p>We sighted the craft at early dawn, and immediately
gave chase—and it was a long one.
Heavy laden as she was, and with less than two-thirds
of our spread of canvas, yet she was
well nigh a match for us in sailing. We overtook
her by inches. The sun was about to set
when we sent a shot across her bow, and it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
gone down when I returned from boarding her
and reported her sailing port, her destination,
her cargo, and the additional facts that she had
a crew of twelve, and carried one passenger—a
Master George Rollins.</p>

<p>Captain Tucker kept her by the frigate all
night. At daylight he transferred to her a score
of prisoners that we had taken from other vessels,
and, placing me in command with a crew
of ten, he directed me to take her into Lynn.
Master Rollins at his own request remained
upon her, and with her captain shared the cabin
with myself and Midshipman Thomas Blinn,
who was my executive officer.</p>

<p>We cleared from the <i>Franklin</i> about nine
o’clock and started on our voyage of two hundred
miles with high hopes. The brig was a
staunch one, and, as I have already intimated,
a fast sailer. Her cargo was valuable, and I
felt what perhaps may be termed a natural elation
to be given the task of taking her into port.
It is true I had a large number of prisoners
between the decks, and two men under parole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
in the cabin, but I anticipated no trouble from
them, and felt myself competent to fulfill the
task assigned me faithfully.</p>

<p>The day was clear and cold. The wind was
a favorable one, and we went ahead at a pace
which would have delighted any sailor’s heart.
In ten hours I estimated that we had covered
nearly one-half the distance to port. Let the
breeze only keep up and we should reach our
haven before noon on the morrow. With much
satisfaction I turned the watch over to Midshipman
Blinn and went below.</p>

<p>Inadvertently the room I occupied was between
that of Captain Williamson and Master
Rollins, while Midshipman Blinn had one on the
other side of the cabin. I had fallen asleep, but
was awakened by someone trying to open my
door. Fortunately, as it proved, I had fastened
it on entering, and discovering this fact the intruder
passed on and gave a light tap at the
door of Master Rollins. The next instant, as
though the newcomer was expected, the door
opened gently, and the man quietly entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>I suddenly remembered that when I stored
my kit under my berth I had noticed a crack in
the partition between the staterooms, and stepping
noiselessly out upon the floor I stooped
down, pushed my bag to one side, and crawled
in beside it. Placing my ear to the crack I was
able to distinguish much that passed between
Master Rollins and his visitor, though they conversed
in whispers.</p>

<p>He was Captain Williamson, as I had suspected,
and had evidently announced his failure
to enter my room, for his companion was saying:</p>

<p>“It is too bad, Captain; so the first part of
your plan fails.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and now I’ll try the second,” was the
response.</p>

<p>“You’ll need to proceed with great caution,
for if discovered they’ll be likely to put you
down with the other prisoners,” Master Rollins
now warned him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the captain admitted, “but it’s worth
the risk. If I can only crawl along to the hatch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
and open it, the vessel is ours again. What we
lack in weapons we shall make up in numbers,
and can easily overpower the half dozen men
on deck. Then Master Dunn down here and the
men in the forecastle can be taken care of at
our leisure.”</p>

<p>“I shall stand by my agreement if you succeed,
Captain Williamson, and add a hundred
pounds to the one I am to give you when you
land me on the cape.”</p>

<p>“I have no fear about that, Master Rollins.
You have done always just as you promised,
but I think this time I shall have earned it,” the
officer commented, and turned to go.</p>

<p>I waited until I had heard him pass my door,
and ascend the ladder to the deck; then I
slipped out of my room and hurried after him.
But the moment my head was above the hatchway
I knew that his second plan had failed, for
Midshipman Blinn had been on the alert, and
detected his presence on deck.</p>

<p>“What does this mean, Captain Williamson?”
he was demanding. “You know as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
as I do that you were not to come on deck during
the night hours. I must insist that you return
to the cabin immediately, or I shall have to put
you in the brig with your men.”</p>

<p>For answer the captain did the most foolish
thing he could have done under the circumstances.
He sprang upon the speaker, doubtless
with the intention of throwing him down, and
passing over him to the middle hatch. Perhaps
he thought that with a quick rush he could
reach it and let out the prisoners before the
watch could prevent him.</p>

<p>But he had underestimated the quickness and
strength of Master Blinn. Leaping to one side,
the Midshipman avoided his antagonist, and
himself became the attacker instead of the attacked.
Grappling the Englishman by the
waist, he called loudly for his men to come to
his aid. I sprang forward to assist him, but
two of the watch were before me, and when I
reached his side, the burly Captain was subdued.
Two minutes later he was in the hold
with the other prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>I quickly acquainted my executive officer with
what I had seen and heard in the cabin, and so
explained how I came to be on the deck so
promptly. Then I said warmly—forgetting all
titles in my appreciation of Master Blinn’s good
work:</p>

<p>“But I hardly was needed here, Tom. You
were too alert for the Captain. No one could
have done better. I shall make a full report of
your part in this affair to Captain Tucker.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Arthur,” he replied heartily,
dropping into the same familiar strain. “But
shall I go down after Master Rollins and put
him in the brig?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not, at least at present,” I replied.
“I judge he is one who leaves the risky
part of his schemes for someone else to do, and
so we have nothing to fear in that direction.
Still, we’ll keep a sharp eye on him, and put
him under arrest the moment we see any reason
for doing so. Now I’ll go back to my room and
finish out my watch below.”</p>

<p>I lay awake some time after reaching my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
berth, and heard our passenger moving uneasily
about his room. Once he cautiously opened his
door, and looked out into the cabin, but he made
no other attempt to investigate into the captain’s
whereabouts, so I went to sleep.</p>

<p>At breakfast, however, he ventured to inquire
if Captain Williamson was sick.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, “he was foolish enough
last night to try to liberate the prisoners, but
Midshipman Blinn was on the alert, and put
him into the hold with them.”</p>

<p>He ate uneasily after that, and soon after,
excusing himself, went back to his stateroom.
Two hours later he sent for me, and, wondering
what this move on his part meant, I slipped
a pistol into my pocket, and went down to see
him.</p>

<p>He closed the door of his room as soon as
I was in it, and pushing a stool towards me, remarked
politely:</p>

<p>“Sit down, Captain Dunn, I wish to have a
little talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I responded shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“I have a proposal to make,” he went on
blandly, “one that will be of great advantage
to you personally.”</p>

<p>I bowed, and waited for him to go on.</p>

<p>“I have reasons,” he continued smoothly,
“for not wishing to land in any New England
port. So I had arranged with Captain Williamson
to put me ashore in some retired spot on
Cape Cod. I was to give him one hundred
pounds in gold for doing this. The capture
of the brig by your frigate has of course made
it impossible for him to fulfill his contract. But
if you will render me the same favor, I shall
be glad to give you the same compensation.”</p>

<p>I thought a moment. There certainly was
something strange in the man’s statement. It
was clear he did not care to face the Continental
authorities, and I could easily understand how
there might be good reasons for that. But why
he was equally anxious to avoid a port like
Boston where the British were in control, for
which the brig was making before her capture,
I could not understand. Puzzle as I would over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
it I could not explain that. Hoping to draw him
out, however, I now said:</p>

<p>“Why not offer me the other hundred pounds
you were going to give Captain Williamson if
he recaptured the vessel?”</p>

<p>He stared at me in sheer amazement. Evidently
how I came to know of this fact perplexed
him. But he finally replied:</p>

<p>“Well, I will do it. Land me in a retired spot
anywhere below Boston, and you shall have the
two hundred pounds.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “I couldn’t think of it for that
amount,” I declared. “Captain Williamson
could do it, and it was none of his crew’s business
why he put you ashore in one place rather
than in another. But here with me is another
officer and ten seamen, any one of whom could
report my act to Captain Tucker. I must have
enough to buy their silence.”</p>

<p>I said this to ascertain to what extent he was
willing to go in order to secure his release,
though I had no idea of accepting any terms he
might propose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“True,” he responded hopefully. “I never
thought of that. Well, you shall have one
thousand pounds in gold for setting me ashore,
and you may divide it up with your men as you
please.”</p>

<p>I was absolutely startled at this offer. Evidently
the whole matter was a more serious one
than I had imagined. Whoever Master Rollins
was, he was too important a personage to be
allowed to go. But to keep up the farce a little
longer I managed to query:</p>

<p>“But how do I know you have got so much
money at your command? That is a big sum,
Master Rollins.”</p>

<p>His face flushed—in anger, I thought, at my
insinuation that he might not be able to pay me
the sum named. If so, he conquered himself,
for in an instant he said haughtily:</p>

<p>“I forget that you do not know me, Captain
Dunn. But you shall see for yourself,” and
pulling out two small leather cases from under
his berth he threw them open, removed a few
garments, and then exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Look!”</p>

<p>I did look with bulging eyes. In one were
coins of gold—guineas, nobles, sovereigns—hundreds
of them; in the other there were coins
of silver—crowns, half-crowns, and farthings
even more numerous.</p>

<p>“I have five thousand pounds there,” he declared,
and I did not doubt him.</p>

<p>But who was this strange man? An army
paymaster? No, or he would have been glad
to have gone into Boston—<i>unless he was absconding
with the money which was to pay the
wages of the British soldiers</i>. Like a flash the
thought came to me. The usual place for a paymaster
was on a frigate, surrounded by a force
that could convey him to his destination beyond
all question. But if he was trying to make off
with the money, what was more natural than
for him to take passage from England to the
Azores, and from there to America where he
would wish to avoid both British and Continental
authorities. In fact, the more quietly
he could slip into the country, the better. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
sure I had found the true explanation why he
made his strange proposal—his tremendous
offer. But that was a matter the Continental
authorities could settle. My duty was clear. It
was to guard the man and his money every
moment until we reached port and I had turned
him over to the proper tribunal. This decision
reached, I said quietly:</p>

<p>“I am satisfied, Master Rollins. Close up
your boxes, and put them back under the
berth.”</p>

<p>He did so, and then remarked: “You see I
can pay you the amount promised, Captain
Dunn, large as it is.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” I admitted, “but come now
with me.”</p>

<p>Without hesitation he followed me into the
cabin.</p>

<p>“Close and lock your door,” I now directed,
and he complied, but in a way that showed he
was a little puzzled by my commands.</p>

<p>“Now come in here,” I continued, throwing
open the door of what had been Captain Williamson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
room, and stepping back to allow him
to enter first. He did so reluctantly, and no
sooner was he well within the room than he
turned upon me asking:</p>

<p>“What does this mean, Captain Dunn?”</p>

<p>“This,” I explained, drawing my pistol from
my pocket and holding it so it was ready for
instant use. “You are evidently too important
A personage to be allowed to escape in any way,
Master Rollins. I shall keep you in here under
guard until we are safe in port, and you have
been turned over to the Continental authorities.
They shall decide who you are, and to whom
your gold and silver rightly belongs. Meantime
you have the satisfaction of knowing it is locked
up and the key is in your pocket. It shall not
be touched until you yourself open the door for
the men to whom I am responsible.” And with
these words I stepped back into the cabin, and
closing the door locked him in. Five minutes
thereafter an armed sailor stood before the
door, nor was it without a guard for a single
moment until we reached Lynn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>With strict instructions to Midshipman Blinn
to take good care of Master Rollins until I returned,
I hurried on shore and visited the Continental
agent. Reporting the prize, I then acquainted
him with the astonishing discovery I
had made, and my own surmise about the
mysterious passenger.</p>

<p>“We will soon know,” he declared after hearing
my story, “and let me add, too, Midshipman
Dunn, you have handled this whole matter with
much discretion and have proved that your love
of country is superior to British gold,” and he
shook my hand warmly.</p>

<p>He returned with me to the brig. First, he
had an interview with Master Rollins, who soon
broke down under his sharp questioning, and
made a full confession.</p>

<p>He was Major Ralph Walker, and a paymaster
in the British army. Entrusted with the
five thousand pounds to pay off the soldiers in
Boston, he had run away with the money and
sailed for the Azores. There he had secured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
passage on the brig, and made his arrangements
with her captain to slip quietly into the colonies,
where he hoped under an assumed name to
enjoy his ill-gotten wealth.</p>

<p>His confession finished, he willingly opened
the door of his stateroom, and delivered all his
personal effects to the Continental official.
Among his baggage were found papers fully
substantiating the story he had told.</p>

<p>The decision of the agent was quickly given.
The circumstances under which the man had
been apprehended made no difference. He was
a British officer, and therefore a legitimate prisoner
of war; the money he carried was British
property, and therefore a legitimate prize; an
opinion sustained by the entire naval committee
a few weeks later. So the five thousand pounds
sterling, added to the value of the brig and her
cargo, made her capture the most valuable prize
our frigate had yet taken.</p>

<p>I never saw Master Rollins, or Major Walker,
as I should call him, again. But I heard some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
months later that he had been liberated on
parole, and had disappeared. Probably he
went to some part of the colonies where he was
unknown, and there began life anew, though in
poverty instead of in wealth as he had planned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>WE CAPTURE A FRIGATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>My orders had been to remain in port with
my crew until the <i>Franklin</i> arrived, as Captain
Tucker, at the time I left him, expected to bring
in his next prize. He did, but it was two weeks
before he came. The prize he brought was a
good one, however, and well worth his fortnight
of waiting. It was a brig from Cork, Ireland,
bound to Boston with a cargo of beef, pork, butter
and coal. There had been a little rumor connected
with her capture, which Lieutenant
Fettyplace told me about soon after his arrival.</p>

<p>The vessel was sighted just before she entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Massachusetts Bay, and a chase began. But
no sooner did she find our frigate was after her
than she turned and came down to meet her.
When near enough she signalled that her captain
would like to come on board but had no
boat, all having been swept from the deck in a
recent gale, as was afterwards explained. So
Captain Tucker sent a yawl after him.</p>

<p>He soon arrived, a short, fat, jolly Irishman.
Bowing low before our commander upon reaching
our deck, he began:</p>

<p>“Faith, yer honor, I’m glad to see ye. I’ve
been standin’ off an’ on here for two weeks now
lookin’ for the likes of ye. I’m Jeremiah
O’Brien, Capt’n of the brig <i>Blackfriar</i>, from
Cork for Boston, with vittles for the British
army. But I’ve got me pay safe in me pocket,
sir, an’ not a snap cares I if me whole cargo
falls into your hands. Nor is that jest the truth,
yer honor. I do care. I’d rather ye Yankees,
as ye are called, would ate the vittles while every
mother’s son of those red-coated spalpeens in
Boston go hungry. So, if ye please to tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
where ye wish me to sail, me men and I’ll become
a prize crew an’ take the brig into port.
Or if ye’re ’fraid to trust me, pint ye own craft
for the harbor, an’ we’ll follow in yer wake.
What’s the course, sir?” and with another low
bow he waited for Captain Tucker to speak.</p>

<p>“This is most extraordinary, sir,” our skipper
said coldly. “Pray may I ask what you
expect for this betrayal of your trust?”</p>

<p>“There’s no betrayal of trust, yer honor,”
he returned somewhat hotly. “I told me ship-owners
I wouldn’t sail the brig over to the colonies
for them without my pay straight down
for the entire voyage, an’ that I was no coward
an’ shouldn’t run away from any armed vessel
that gave me chase, however big it was, but that
they must run the risk of my capture. I’m a
man of my word, sir. Ye began to chase me,
an’ not a bit did I run from ye. Here I am
standing boldly on your deck, though at the risk
of losin’ me brig. What’s the odds, sir? If I
don’t give ye the vessel, ye’ll take her, so she’s
yours under either circumstance. An’ do ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
ask what I expect? It’s the privilege of enlistin’
in yer navy soon as I’m in port, sir, where I can
do my best to feed yer Yankee soljers by capturin’
just such craft as that,” and he waved
his hand towards the <i>Blackfriar</i>, while our men
broke into a cheer.</p>

<p>The outcome of this singular interview was
that Captain O’Brien and his crew actually
sailed the brig into Lynn, following in the wake
of the <i>Franklin</i>; and soon after she arrived
there her commander entered our navy as a
lieutenant and did loyal service for the colonies.</p>

<p>The frigate sailed again within a few days,
but we did not go with her. By “we” I mean
Captain Tucker and myself. Two or three days
after his arrival in port the Captain was notified
that he was to be transferred to the <i>Hancock</i>.
He was kind enough to request that I also be
transferred, a request that was promptly
granted.</p>

<p>This transfer was for both of us a promotion,
at least we so regarded it; a promotion for Captain
Tucker, for the <i>Hancock</i>, though schooner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
rigged, was larger than the <i>Franklin</i>, and carried
eight more guns and fifty more men; a promotion
for myself, for though I still held only a
midshipman’s commission, I was the senior
officer in my rank, and on the new vessel was
assigned to the duties of a third lieutenant, and
received a third lieutenant’s pay. Our first
officer was Lieutenant Richard Stiles, and our
second Lieutenant Nicholas Ogilby.</p>

<p>We left port May 9th (1776), and ran up the
coast for our first cruise. For a time the good
fortune that had attended us when on the frigate
seemed to desert us. Instead of running in
with a prize immediately we sailed north as
far as Cape Race without even catching sight
of one. In fact it was not until we had turned
our bow homeward that we discovered anything
to chase. Then we ran in with the ship <i>Peggy</i>
which eventually became ours, and proved to be
the most valuable vessel and cargo we had
taken. I say eventually became ours, for there
were circumstances connected with her capture
as singular as interesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>We sighted her in the latitude of Halifax—just
after she had left port as it afterward
proved—and sailed down towards her. Soon
we were near enough to see she carried eight
guns, and had a score or more of men on her
deck. While we watched a flag was run up to
her peak, and under the glass we made out that
it was similar to the one flying at our masthead—at
least there was a pine tree upon it.</p>

<p>“She must be an American privateer,” remarked
Lieutenant Stiles when Captain Tucker
announced this fact.</p>

<p>“Then why does she set so low in the water?”
the Captain queried. “There must be a heavy
cargo between her decks for her to settle down
like that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she has taken some prize and for
some reason transferred its cargo to her own
hold,” suggested Lieutenant Ogilby.</p>

<p>“It is possible, of course,” admitted Captain
Tucker. “We will run up and speak with her.”</p>

<p>She was so heavily loaded we had no difficulty
in overhauling her, and to Captain Tucker’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
hail: “On board ship! Who are you?”
there came the prompt answer: “American
privateer <i>Peggy</i>, from Machias, Captain Edward
Saunders. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Continental schooner of war <i>Hancock</i>, Captain
Samuel Tucker, on a cruise.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of you, Captain Tucker, and
am now glad to see you,” shouted the skipper
of the <i>Peggy</i>. “Wish I was near enough to
shake hands with you. Hope you are having
your usual good luck in securing prizes.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! but we have run in with nothing on
this cruise,” said our commander. “But judging
by the draught of your vessel, Captain
Saunders, you have had a better fortune.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the response. “We captured a
brig yesterday. But the shot we meant to send
across her bow struck her in the water line.
We had only time to transfer her cargo to our
own hold, when she went down. We are now
in no condition for a chase and so are homeward
bound.”</p>

<p>“A safe voyage home!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“The same to you!”</p>

<p>And then we sheered off and ran out to sea,
while the privateer kept on down the coast.
Two days later we were below the Seal Islands
when our lookout reported a sail dead ahead
of us.</p>

<p>“What does she look like!” asked Lieutenant
Stiles, who at that time was in charge of the
deck.</p>

<p>“Blast me, sir! She looks all the world like
that ship <i>Peggy</i>,” was the old salt’s ejaculation.
“Only whoever she is, she’s flying the British
flag.”</p>

<p>I was sent aloft with my glass to see if I could
make her out, but could only confirm the report
of the lookout.</p>

<p>“Keep your eye on her, Master Dunn,” the
lieutenant directed. “We’ll run down nearer
to her.”</p>

<p>In a half-hour I called out:</p>

<p>“She is certainly the ship <i>Peggy</i>, but she is
carrying the English colors. No! there she runs
them down, and is hoisting the Pine Tree flag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
in their place. Can it be she has changed them
because she has discovered we are following
her?”</p>

<p>“It looks that way, Midshipman Dunn,” the
officer assented. “I’ll report the matter to Captain
Tucker.”</p>

<p>He immediately came on deck, climbed up to
the cross-trees, and, taking the glass from my
hand, looked long and searchingly at the distant
sail, and then said:</p>

<p>“There is something strange about this,
Master Dunn. She is far south of her home
port. We’ll overhaul her again, and look at her
papers.”</p>

<p>In another hour we were in hailing distance,
and Captain Tucker shouted:</p>

<p>“Ahoy, there, privateer <i>Peggy</i>! How comes
it we find you down here?”</p>

<p>“We have decided to run down to Portsmouth,”
the voice of Captain Saunders
answered.</p>

<p>“Heave to! I must have a look at your
papers,” our commander then announced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“That’s all right. I’ll bring them over at
once,” was the ready response.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Peggy</i> hove to; a boat was put out,
mid Captain Saunders came over to us. Greeting
him politely, Captain Tucker led him down
to the cabin. Then his visitor handed his papers
to him. The Captain passed them on to me as
his secretary, saying: “Look them over, Midshipman
Dunn;” then entered into conversation
with his guest.</p>

<p>I went carefully through the documents.
They were regularly made out, and there was
not the slightest reason for doubting the
<i>Peggy’s</i> claim to be an American privateer.</p>

<p>“The papers are all right, sir,” I announced,
“though I would rather you would pass judgment
upon them.”</p>

<p>He smiled, and taking them glanced at them.
Then he said to Captain Saunders:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sir, for putting you to all this
trouble. But you know the enemy is now using
all sorts of means to deceive us, and we have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
follow out our merest suspicions if we do not
want to be outwitted.”</p>

<p>“That is so, Captain Tucker,” his visitor
responded. “I know something about that myself.
You don’t feel very well to find they have
made a fool of you. But you are a sharp one,
Captain. It will take a smart man to get the
best of you. No apology, however, is necessary
for delaying me. Really, I’m glad to have made
you this brief visit,” and he arose to depart.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the vessels for the second
time parted company.</p>

<p>“I wonder why the Captain did not ask him
about his flying the English flag,” I remarked
to Lieutenant Ogilby, to whom I had been relating
what had occurred in the cabin.</p>

<p>“He must have forgotten it,” that officer said.</p>

<p>“Oh, the papers being straight, he doubtless
thought it none of his business,” chimed in
Lieutenant Stiles, who joined us at that moment.</p>

<p>Three days later we were off Cape Cod when
our lookout again called out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Ship in sight, sir, two points off our starboard
quarter.”</p>

<p>“Not the ship <i>Peggy</i> this time is it, Jake?”
inquired Lieutenant Stiles, for again he happened
to be in charge of the deck, while the same
old salt was in the cross-trees.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the unexpected response.
“Ship <i>Peggy</i>, that is what she is, sir; and she
has the British flag at her peak, and is sailin’
to round the cape. Guess she’s goin’ to New
York this time, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Stiles went up the mast at a
bound, and gazed at the sail through his glass
for some minutes. Then he came down as rapidly
as he had gone up, and said to me as he
passed on his way to the cabin:</p>

<p>“It’s she, Master Dunn, and she’s changed
her flag again now that she has discovered our
approach.”</p>

<p>He returned in a moment with Captain
Tucker, who was as excited as himself. The
look on my face as I glanced at him led him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
stop abruptly and ask: “What do you think
of her, Master Dunn?”</p>

<p>“That she is a British merchantman, bound
for New York, with a cargo so valuable she is
taking extraordinary means to prevent capture.
She has double papers, sir, and has shown only
the false ones to us.”</p>

<p>“I think you have struck the nail on the head
this time,” he declared. “But if we again
overhaul her, she won’t outwit us again.”</p>

<p>Possibly her captain was of a similar opinion,
for he did his best to keep out of our clutches.
It was clear he did not relish a third interview
with Captain Tucker.</p>

<p>It was, however, inevitable. Gradually we
came up with the craft, and a shot from our
bow-chaser brought her to.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="p1581_ill">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p1581_ill.jpg" alt="Master Dunn, you are my prisoner">

<p class="right">(p. <a href="#prisoner">97</a>)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Take the yawl and ten men with you, Lieutenant
Stiles, and send Captain Saunders over
here, no matter how much he may protest, while
you remain there and make a thorough search
of his cabin. Find everything you can to throw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>light on the ship’s real character,” was Captain
Tucker’s command.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” the officer responded in a
tone that showed he relished the order; and I
confess I almost envied him his assignment.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes Captain Saunders was on
our deck, angrily declaring that Captain Tucker’s
procedure was an outrage. At that moment
my arm was pulled by Bill Nye, an old
sailor.</p>

<p>“I ax yer pardon, sir,” he said in a loud
whisper, “but that ain’t Capt’n Saunders, it’s
Captain John Linscot of Halifax. I’se sailed
with him more’n once to the West Indies.”</p>

<p>“Come with me, Bill!” I said, leading him
aft.</p>

<p>Reaching the two captains I announced:</p>

<p>“Captain Tucker, here’s a man who wishes to
throw a little light on the question you are trying
to settle.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Bill?” the Captain inquired,
while his prisoner suddenly stopped talking and
stared at the old sailor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“I only wishes to say, sir, that I know that
man. I’se sailed more’n once with him. He’s
Capt’n John Linscot of Halifax.”</p>

<p>“Man, you are mistaken,” thundered the discomfited
skipper.</p>

<p>“We shall soon know,” Captain Tucker remarked
quietly. “Lieutenant Stiles is returning.”</p>

<p>A minute or two later the yawl touched the
schooner’s side, and the executive officer, leaping
to her deck, crossed over to where the captain
was standing. Saluting him he reported:</p>

<p>“I find, sir, that yonder ship is not an American
privateer, but an English merchantman
from London to Halifax, where she changed
captains and then sailed for New York. She
has a cargo of muskets, pistols, ammunition, and
army supplies inventoried at fifteen thousand
pounds sterling.”</p>

<p>As he closed his report the English captain
laughed.</p>

<p>“I admit it, Captain Tucker. I knew you
were cruising off our coast, and prepared those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
privateer papers to outwit you, and succeeded
twice. I could hardly expect to do it a third
time. I congratulate you, sir, on taking the
finest prize that is likely to be on these seas this
season.”</p>

<p>“I can afford to be as magnanimous, and confess
that you are the smartest Englishman I
ever met,” our commander responded.</p>

<p>“I told you at our last interview that it took
a smart man to outwit you,” the Britisher retorted,
“but I don’t feel as smart as I did
then.”</p>

<p>A hearty laugh followed and the rival captains
shook hands. Then a large prize crew
was put on board the <i>Peggy</i>, and, under the escort
of the <i>Hancock</i>, for she was too great a
treasure to send into port alone, she sailed for
Lynn.</p>

<p>In a week we were at sea again, and a rich
series of captures followed. Between that time
and the next spring we took forty vessels,
many of them with valuable cargoes.</p>

<p>Then came a prize, the thought of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
makes my blood tingle even to this day. We
had been into Salem with prizes. Soon after
getting out to sea we caught sight of a distant
sail. On approaching her we discovered by her
tier of guns that she was an English frigate—much
larger than the <i>Hancock</i>. Undismayed,
Captain Tucker turned to his executive officer,
saying:</p>

<p>“Crowd on all sail, Lieutenant Stiles. The
sooner we can close in with that fellow the better.”</p>

<p>When this command had been obeyed, he continued:</p>

<p>“Have the drum beat all hands to quarters.
I wish to address them.”</p>

<p>When we were in place, he said:</p>

<p>“Men of the <i>Hancock</i>! I suspect yonder frigate
is the <i>Fox</i>, which for some weeks has been
scourging our shores. As you see, she is larger
than we are, and carries twelve more guns. I
shall not therefore enter into a cannon duel
with her. I shall put our vessel alongside of
her and board her. The moment we touch sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
I wish three different parties to be ready to leap
upon her deck—one forward, one aft, and one
amidships. Midshipman Dunn is to lead the
first, Lieutenant Ogilby the second, and Lieutenant
Magee, commander of the marines, the
third.”</p>

<p>Noticing that the latter officer seemed to hesitate,
as though he would decline the desperate
office, he turned to him, saying with a smile:</p>

<p>“If you prefer, sir, you may take my place
here, and I will lead the boarders, for she must
be taken.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the gallant young officer, “I
will go and do my best, and if I fall, will you
send these to my only sister?” and he handed
the captain a ring, a watch, and a miniature.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, by a sudden and rapid
change of the helm—for in nautical manœuvering
Captain Tucker was unsurpassed by any
officer in the infant navy—he laid our vessel
alongside of the frigate, gun to gun, and before
a shot could be fired, or a piece of ordnance
brought to bear upon us, he threw his grappling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
irons upon her gunwale, and our boarding parties
poured down upon her deck.</p>

<p>I can give you little idea of the terrific hand-to-hand
conflict that now took place. I was a
part of the battle, not a spectator of it. But I
know that the intrepid Magee fell in the onset.
Heading his band of marines, he leaped the bulwark,
but scarcely had his feet touched the deck
of the enemy before he was assailed by numbers
and a sword pierced his breast.</p>

<p>But his death was not unavenged. Captain
Tucker, seeing him fall, leaped like a lion into
his place, and with his stalwart arm cut down
all before him. Having made an open way
across the deck for his men, he rallied them into
two lines, back to back, and fought his opponents
in both directions, forward and aft.</p>

<p>Meantime I had reached my position with my
division and we drove all on the bow back to
meet the dauntless Captain, while Lieutenant
Ogilby and his men, charging the quarter-deck,
drove the enemy forward against our commander’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
second line drawn up to receive them. In
this way we soon swept the deck, and the frigate
struck her colors. Three rousing cheers from
our brave men proclaimed the victory.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>A DISTINGUISHED PASSENGER ON BOARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I come now to an incident about which I love
to write. It was the Christmas present given
Captain Tucker the following December (1777).
This was the brand new frigate <i>Boston</i>. She
was presented to him in Boston, and named for
that town. She carried twenty-four guns and
one hundred and seventy-five men, beside her
company of marines, and in her equipment surpassed
any other vessel in commission at that
time.</p>

<p>But not only was the vessel given the Captain;
he was also given the privilege of selecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
all of his commissioned officers. It took him a
month to complete the list. Our three lieutenants
were Henry Phips, Hezekiah Welch and
Benjamin Bates, ranking in the order they are
named. We had five midshipmen, of whom I
held the senior rank. The second was Thomas
Blinn, who had been with us on the <i>Franklin</i>
and who was appointed to the new frigate at
my request. The other three were new men to
us, but gallant fellows who had given a good account
of themselves on other vessels. They
were William Day, Edward Eades, and Thomas
LeMoyne.</p>

<p>Our master of arms was William Baker from
the <i>Hancock</i>; and one of our boatswains was
also an old friend, Joseph Lewis from the
<i>Franklin</i>. I believe all the rest of our officers
and crew were new men. We had a chaplain,
Rev. Benjamin Balch, and a surgeon, Dr.
Thomas Burns. The officers of our marines
were Captain Seth Boxter, First Lieutenant
Jeremiah Reed, Second Lieutenant William
Cooper, and Sergeant Benjamin Newhall. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
speak of these different officers here so that
when they are hereafter alluded to in this narrative
the reader may have a clear idea of their
place on shipboard.</p>

<p>From the hour we went on board the <i>Boston</i>
we had the feeling that she was to be assigned
to some important mission. No one had said
so, yet among the officers and crew alike there
was a feeling of expectancy. Perhaps it was
the newness of the vessel, her fine equipment,
the special care taken in selecting her men and
putting in of her stores that gave rise to this
impression.</p>

<p>We went on board of the craft December 27th.
The new year came, a month passed, but still we
waited. The first of February an incident occurred
which led us to believe the time of our
sailing was drawing near. A new banner arrived
for the frigate—the flag adopted by the
American Congress and destined to be known
ere long the world over as the emblem of liberty—the
stars and stripes. Amid the cheers of our
men it was unfurled from our masthead, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
in the case of the Pine Tree banner on the
<i>Franklin</i>, so now it was my own hand that
pulled the rope that set the bunting free.</p>

<p>Nine days later Captain Tucker was summoned
before the Chairman of the Naval Committee.
I now know what took place at that
interview, and will relate it here.</p>

<p>“Sir,” the official said, “you are directed by
the American Congress to receive the Honorable
John Adams upon your frigate and convey
him as a special envoy to France. I am also
instructed to add that in some way the object
of this mission to France has become known to
the enemy and they have already sent a British
seventy-four and two other frigates up from
Newport to keep watch over this harbor and
prevent if possible the departure of the vessel
which is to carry the envoy. To escape a force
so vigilant and formidable, and to avoid the
numerous men-of-war which infest the track
across the Atlantic, requires an officer of consummate
skill and intrepidity. Congress has
full confidence in you, and for that reason has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
chosen you commander of the vessel which is to
perform this mission. In this document are
your orders in detail, which we shall expect you
to execute to the letter,” and he handed the
paper to the Captain, who, receiving it, replied:</p>

<p>“I assure you, sir, and the other members of
the Naval Committee, that I appreciate the
honor conferred upon me, and shall endeavor
to the best of my ability to merit the confidence
you repose in me. If for any reason I fail to
reach the assigned port with my distinguished
passenger, it will not be because I have been unfaithful
to my trust.”</p>

<p>On the 16th day of the month Master Adams
was received on board of the <i>Boston</i> with all
the honors of his high position; and on the 17th,
at seven P. M., we weighed anchor at the Nantasket
Roads, and proceeded to sea, with the
stripes and stars waving to a fine northwestern
breeze, and with the firing of a salute of seven
guns.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the log-book of that voyage,
which now lies before me, are the words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
written in Captain Tucker’s own hand: “Pray
God conduct me safe to France, and send me a
prosperous voyage.” This brief but all inclusive
prayer was granted, but not without
some mishaps, and some occasions for doubt
and fear.</p>

<p>Our departure at nightfall had been purposely
arranged to slip by the watching frigates
at the mouth of the bay under the cover of the
darkness. Without a light we moved swiftly
down the harbor, and when below Long Island
were able to make out the lights of the three
English vessels, a mile or two apart, and sailing
to and fro in a way to intercept any craft that
might attempt to leave the haven by the usual
routes.</p>

<p>The seventy-four was farthest north, and her
great draught prevented her from running
within two miles of the shore. Captain Tucker,
who stood near the helm, was quick to notice
this fact, and gave orders to sail the <i>Boston</i>
between the great frigate and the land. Possibly
the Britisher was not expecting a vessel so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
large as the <i>Boston</i> to take this course, and so
kept no special lookout in that direction; or it
may be that the absence of lights rendered our
ship invisible at that distance in the darkness.
For some reason we made the passage in safety,
and in an hour were well out to sea.</p>

<p>In some way, however, the enemy must have
learned of our departure for on the 19th at six
P. M., we saw three large ships to the east of us,
bearing the British flag and concluded that they
were the ones watching especially for us. Captain
Tucker at once gave orders for our frigate
to haul away to the south-west, and so far as we
were able to detect in the darkness we were not
pursued. Early the next morning the captain
called all of his commissioned officers into consultation,
and, as the enemy were nowhere in
sight, it was decided to return to our original
course. We had run but an hour to the northward,
however, when we caught sight of two of
the pursuing frigates—one of twenty guns, the
other, like ourselves, of twenty-four guns. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
almost immediately the man at the masthead
called out:</p>

<p>“Ship of war on our weather quarter, sir!”</p>

<p>In a short time we were confident it was the
English seventy-four. This settled the fact that
our enemies were both persistent and vigilant,
and would intercept us if they could.</p>

<p>Another consultation was therefore held to
which Master Adams was invited, and our situation
was freely discussed. Not knowing how
fast the <i>Boston</i> would sail, it was concluded to
stand away again for the south-west, and at ten
A. M., we wore ship and proceeded in that direction.
The three Britishers promptly changed
their courses, and pursued us.</p>

<p>At noon we had lost sight of the smaller vessel;
at two o’clock we set our fore and maintop mast
steering sail, and soon found we were leaving
the other vessels behind. At six we had lost
sight of them in the darkness.</p>

<p>An anxious night followed. We were running
at the rate of seven knots an hour, and we had
reason to believe that the other vessels were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
making as good a pace. Would they continue
on their present course throughout the night?
If so, could we not by dropping off a point or
two throw them off our track? These and similar
questions arose in the mind not only of our
commander, but also in the minds of all of our
officers.</p>

<p>Double watches were kept on the deck. Captain
Tucker never left it. For three hours we
held to the course we had been following before
nightfall. Then we fell off a little, though it reduced
our speed to six knots. We ran on the
new course for another three hours, and then to
our chagrin our lookout reported the lights of
a large ship almost directly ahead of us. It was
evident that while we had shaken off the smaller
frigate, the seventy-four was still on our trail.</p>

<p>We could not weather her on our present
course, so we hove in stays and stood to the
westward. She followed us. For an hour or
two we held to the new direction, then we suddenly
hove in stays again, and passed her to the
windward, and about four miles off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>But she detected the movement, and changing
her own course, continued to chase us. Again
tacking ship, we soon had the satisfaction of
knowing we had at last struck a course in which
the <i>Boston</i> was distancing her enemy, and when
morning dawned she was out of sight, and we
saw no further trace of her.</p>

<p>But barely had we escaped one danger when
we ran in with another. A north-east gale swept
down upon us, and for nine days we battled with
wind and rain and sleet and snow, and were
compelled at times to heave to, and at other
times to sheer around and run before the storm.
I do not think we gained a hundred miles on our
way during the tempest.</p>

<p>Then came gentle breezes from the south, the
temperature moderated, the snow and ice that
had encased us disappeared, and we made fair
progress towards our destination.</p>

<p>One day during this spring-like weather, we
sighted a vessel to the south-east, which was
standing to the west. We changed our course
to intercept her, and in a short time were able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to make out that she was a large merchantman,
carrying twelve guns.</p>

<p>There was no question but that she also saw
us; and seeing us, she must have known that we
were larger than she, and mounted two guns to
her one. Yet she made no attempt to escape us,
or, for that matter, to come up with us. She
simply kept on her way. When a little nearer,
however, we noticed that her plucky commander
was preparing himself for an attack. All hands
had been piped to their stations. His guns were
being shotted, and made ready for firing. His
attitude said as plainly as words: “Let me
alone, and I’ll let you alone. But if you attack
me, you’ll find me ready. I shall defend myself
to the best of my ability.” Though we had not
yet spoken a word with him, he inspired us with
a feeling of profoundest respect.</p>

<p>Had we been without our distinguished passenger,
we should have hastened to the attack.
But our first duty was to care for his safety,
though there had been nothing in Captain Tucker’s
orders to prevent him from taking a prize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
if she fell in his way. Confident that the ship
ahead of him must contain a valuable cargo, or
she would not be so heavily armed, our commander
felt it would be a grave mistake to allow
her to pass unmolested. Yet he would not assume
the responsibility of attempting her capture
alone. He therefore called Master Adams
and his officers into council, frankly stating his
wish to seize the magnificent ship now in sight.</p>

<p>Master Adams was the first to speak when he
had stated the case:</p>

<p>“If I were not here, Captain Tucker,” he
said, “you would not hesitate at all in making
the attack, would you?”</p>

<p>“Not an instant,” acknowledged the captain.</p>

<p>“Then consider that I am not here, and go
ahead,” continued the brave envoy. “I agree
with you that yonder vessel must have a fine
cargo, or she would not take along twelve guns
and at least two score men to protect it. If so
valuable to her government, it is more valuable
to us. We should not miss the opportunity to
make it ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>That settled the matter, and instantly the
frigate was alive with activity. The men were
drummed to their stations; the reefs were
shaken out of our top-sails; the guns were made
ready for action; the marines were drawn up
amidships ready to rake the deck of the enemy
with their muskets; and away we dashed in pursuit
of the craft.</p>

<p>Having executed my last order, I paused a
moment to glance about me. What a fine appearance
the frigate made when ready for battle!
How earnest and reliant our men seemed!
For an instant I was lost in admiration of the
scene, and then my attention was diverted. I
saw Master Adams seize a musket, and take his
place with the marines. Evidently he was going
to take part in the fray. But the Captain discovered
him a little later, and stepping up to
him and placing his hand on his shoulder, he
said with a voice of authority:</p>

<p>“Master Adams, I am commanded by the
Continental Congress to deliver you safe in
France, and you must go below, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Master Adams smiled, and went down to the
cabin, but with such evident reluctance our men
broke into a cheer.</p>

<p>By this time we were well up with the ship,
and our skipper by one of those quick manœuvers
for which he was noted put his own vessel
into the position he desired. His guns were
ready, his men were at their posts, the match
stocks were smoking and yet he hesitated to
give the order to fire. At this delay the crew
grew impatient, and, seeing so fine a chance to
strike a fatal blow passing, they began to murmur.
Then Captain Tucker cried out in a loud
voice:</p>

<p>“Hold on, my men! I wish to save that egg
without breaking the shell!”</p>

<p>Nor were they compelled to hold on long, for
the commander of the merchantman, plucky as
he was, saw the advantageous position our frigate
was in, and how desperate his own chance
was, and so he struck his colors without our
firing a gun.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>TO HALIFAX PRISON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Ten minutes after her flag was run down I
was upon her deck with a prize crew. Midshipman
Blinn was with me, and I soon sent him
back to the frigate with a report that gave both
officers and crew much satisfaction. The prize
was the ship <i>Martha</i>, Captain Peter McIntosh,
bound from London to New York with a cargo
of provisions, stores, and merchandise, valued
at eighty thousand pounds sterling. The crew
consisted of thirty-nine officers and men, and
there were five passengers, making a total of
forty-four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Master Blinn returned in a short time with
an order from Captain Tucker, putting me in
temporary charge of the vessel, and directing
me to first send her crew and passengers to the
<i>Boston</i> for safe keeping, and then, since it was
nearly night, to tack ship and follow the frigate
on her course until morning.</p>

<p>At dawn a change was made in my ship’s
company. Midshipman Blinn was recalled to
the <i>Boston</i>, and Midshipman LeMoyne was substituted
in his place, to act as my executive.
Philip Mohyes, a quartermaster, was also sent
over to be my second officer. With him came six
new men, increasing my crew to fifteen. Master
LeMoyne brought with him the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“On board the <i>Boston</i> Frigate.<br>
<span class="indentright2">March the 11th, 1778.</span></p>

<p>To Midshipman Arthur Dunn:</p>

<p>Gentleman—You are now appointed to the
command of the ship <i>Martha</i>. I desire you
would make the best of your way to Boston, running
up your longitude in 37° north as far as
68° west. Be careful to avoid all vessels you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
may see, keeping a man at the masthead from
daybreak until dark, and if you should be so unfortunate
as to be taken, destroy my letters with
your signals. If you go safe, lodge my signals
at the Navy Board, not showing them to your
nearest friend. Be very certain of your lights—to
show none in any respect. When you arrive,
acquaint the Honorable Board of every
instance that has happened in my passage, and
I desire you would be as attentive to the ship in
port as at sea. Keep regular orders, as you
would at sea, and the men under the same subjection.
Other orders are to yourself discretionary
in defending the ship.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your well-wisher,</span><br>
<span class="indentright3"><span class="smcap">Samuel Tucker</span>,</span><br>
Commanding.”</p>
</div>

<p>As rapidly as possible I made my arrangements
for a departure, and soon signalled the
frigate that I was ready to sail. A salute of
seven guns was fired, and then with every stitch
of canvas set I bore away west-north-west to
reach the latitude assigned me, and along which
I was to make my way home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>Three days passed without special incident.
We reached the thirty-seventh parallel, and proceeded
westward. Once or twice we caught
sight of distant sails, but if they saw us they
did not think we were worth the chasing. So
when the sun went down on the third night after
we had parted from the frigate our log showed
we had made four hundred knots and all was
well.</p>

<p>All was well when the sun set; all was not so
well when the sun arose; for there, not over two
miles away, was an English frigate of thirty-two
guns, and a few minutes of watching revealed
that she was fast overhauling us.</p>

<p>I could not then, nor can I after all these
years, discover any reason why we were to
blame for the dilemma in which we now found
ourselves. I had strictly obeyed the orders
which Captain Tucker had given me. We had
carried no lights during the night, and it could
not therefore have been these that had attracted
the attention of the enemy, and led him to pursue
us. It was clearly one of those cases of happen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
so, over which we have no control. The
Britisher had happened to be cruising in that
locality; the dawn had disclosed our proximity,
and she had given chase.</p>

<p>But whatever the circumstances, they could
not change the fact that we were pursued by a
foe so formidable that, should she overhaul us,
it would be folly to resist her. Our only hope
was to keep out of her clutches, and even this
I confess was not at that time very reassuring.
Still we did all we could to distance her. I gave
orders to spread every sail, and to put the ship
on a course where I knew she would do her
best. An hour passed, and so far as we could
detect, our pursued was no nearer than when
we had discovered her. Our hopes brightened.
Could we only hold our present rate of speed
throughout the day, we might with the coming
of the night elude her.</p>

<p>Noon came. The frigate was nearer us than
in the morning, but still too far away to reach
us with her cannon. The rate she was gaining
on us made it doubtful that she would come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
within firing distance before sunset. Every
man on our ship breathed easier.</p>

<p>At four o’clock she fired a shot, but it fell
fifty fathoms short of us—far enough away to
escape us, yet too uncomfortably near to be
pleasant. It was disagreeable to feel that a gain
of three hundred feet would allow the ball to
drop on our deck.</p>

<p>I had already resorted to nearly every device
I could conceive of to increase the speed of our
craft. One remained—the wetting of our sails—but
the low temperature had prevented me
from trying that. It would not only mean cold
work for us, but also an icy deck and sails. Still,
anything was preferable to our falling into the
hands of the enemy, and I therefore turned to
Master LeMoyne, and asked him the advisability
of making the experiment.</p>

<p>“Do you notice how the jibs are bellowing?”
he responded. “Why not try the water on
them? It will enable them to hold the wind, and
may be sufficient to keep the ship out of the
Britisher’s reach until dark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>I accepted the suggestion, and in five minutes
had our brave men dashing the icy water on the
canvas. It was not long before the effect was
noticeable. We actually gained upon the frigate,
and at sundown she was over a mile away.</p>

<p>The night came rapidly on, but not so dark as
we could wish. Still I hoped that with no lights
set we might get beyond the vision of the pursuer,
and then, changing our course, elude her.
Anxiously we waited for the moment to come
when it would be safe for us to make the attempt.</p>

<p>It was long in coming, for the man-of-war did
not hesitate to put out her own lights, and was
therefore plainly invisible to us, while it made it
difficult for us to decide whether she could see
us or not. Not far from nine o’clock, however,
I concluded we could not discern the frigate
were it not for her lights, and reasoned that she
could no longer perceive us. So I ordered our
course changed to due east. Two minutes later
our pursuer altered her own course and followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
us. It was clear she could still make us
out notwithstanding the darkness.</p>

<p>After a half-hour’s run to the eastward I became
convinced that we were losing ground, and
resumed our former course. The English craft
as promptly swung in behind us.</p>

<p>“They have good eyes on board yonder frigate,”
I remarked to Quartermaster Mohyes,
who stood near me.</p>

<p>“That they have, sir,” he assented, “and unless
we get a cloudy sky before morning I fear
we shan’t shake them off at all, sir.”</p>

<p>It was a fear that kept every one of us on the
deck that night—a fear that grew more and
more into a certainty. Ten times I changed our
helm; ten times the pursuing vessel took our
trail—and morning came with her less than a
half mile behind us.</p>

<p>To add to our discomfiture the stiff breeze
of the last twenty-four hours died away to an occasional
puff. Under the light wind with our
heavy cargo we scarcely moved, while the frigate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
of lighter draft, crept steadily down upon
us.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock a shot from her bow gun carried
away our maintopmast, and sent sails and
spars tumbling to the deck. This crippled us
and enabled her to gain rapidly upon us, and
soon she was where she could pour a broadside
in upon us.</p>

<p>“Heave to, or we’ll sink you,” her commander
shouted out, and with a heavy heart I gave the
order to heave to the ship; then I hastened below,
where, mindful of Captain Tucker’s command,
I destroyed the record of his signals, and
his letter to me.</p>

<p>When I came out of the cabin a boat from
our capturer was at our side. An instant later
the officer in charge mounted to the deck and
called out in per-emptory tones:</p>

<p>“What craft is this? And who is in command
of her?”</p>

<p>“The ship <i>Martha</i>, a prize of the Continental
frigate <i>Boston</i>, Midshipman Arthur Dunn with
a crew of fifteen in charge, and bound for Boston,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
I replied with the best grace I could assume.</p>

<p>“Show me the ship’s original papers,” he demanded.</p>

<p>Having anticipated such a request I had the
papers with me, and now handed them to him.
He looked them over, and then began to laugh
uproariously. Finally he managed to say:</p>

<p>“This is rich. Thought you’d got a fine prize,
didn’t you? Planned to carry this cargo into
Boston to feed your Yankee soldiers? Well, let
me tell you ‘there’s many a slip between the cup
and lip,’ and they’ll be a hungry lot before they
ever eat of these stores. Captain Watson will
see that they are sent to New York where they
were designed to go. I’ve got a brother there to
whom I shall write the whole story. Won’t he
and his comrades laugh when they hear how we
took the bread right out of the mouth of your
fellows!”</p>

<p>I made no reply, perhaps because I was not in
sympathy with his hilarity. Then he called a
half dozen of his men to the deck and put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
ship in their care, while he went back to the
frigate to report to his commander.</p>

<p>Something in his report, or else the long chase
I had led him, had ruffled the captain’s temper,
for he made quick work in disposing of us. In
fifteen minutes we were transferred to the man-of-war,
and confined in her brig.</p>

<p>The hatch that imprisoned us shut the <i>Martha</i>
from our view, and we thought we had seen the
last of her. Some of us had, but it was my privilege
to see her again some months later and to
learn her remarkable history.</p>

<p>The frigate put a strong crew upon her, and
ordered her to sail in her wake to Halifax, the
nearest British port. During the following
night she in some way became separated from
her consort, and before she could rejoin her was
captured by a Continental privateer, who took
her into Boston. So, contrary to the boast of
the officer into whose hands I had surrendered
her, our Yankee soldiers did feed upon her
stores.</p>

<p>Had we known this not only as we lay in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
darkness of the hold of the <i>Royal Prince</i>, but
during the more trying days that followed, I am
quite sure our hearts would have been lighter.
As it was, to the sufferings we had to bear was
added the chagrin of the loss of the valuable
vessel which had been entrusted to our care. At
times I wondered what Captain Tucker would
say when the tidings reached him. Would he
blame us? Then I would think: “It matters
little, for we shall never meet again.”</p>

<p>Three days of darkness, of vermin, of filth
and of scanty fare made us ready to exchange
our quarters in the frigate for any other—it
mattered not what they were or where. We
knew they could not be worse. So three days
later when we heard the rattling of the chains
which told the vessel had come to anchor, and
our hatch was opened and we were bidden to
come forth, we obeyed the summons with delight.</p>

<p>The bright sunshine, the fresh air, never
seemed so good before, and as we entered the
waiting boats, and were taken ashore—in a town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
which I at once recognized as Halifax—we were
almost happy. Even when our captors, after
our landing, conducted us up the street to the
massive jail, we did not despair. There would
at least be light there, even if the filth and fare
were the same we had experienced on shipboard,
and that would be something for the better.
So with a firm tread and good courage we
passed through the massive portals, where we
were thrust into a room already overflowing
with prisoners.</p>

<p>In five minutes we were ready to go back to
the ship’s hold without a murmur; and I hesitate
to write the reason why lest the reader may
think I state an untruth. It hardly seems possible
that the worst of men could be guilty of so
atrocious an act. Yet I am giving here the
simple fact. We had been put into a room
where the smallpox was raging. Nearly one-half
of the score of men there were sick with the
foul disease, and yet without medical attendance
of any kind.</p>

<p>The place reeked with filth; the air was poisoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
with contagious germs; the room was too
small for the number of prisoners already there;
the condition of the place must have been known
to the prison authorities; yet into this pest-hole
I was thrust with my fifteen men. No foe
could have perpetrated a more gross cruelty; no
fiends in human shape could have shown a
greater malignity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>ON BOARD A BRITISH FRIGATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It is impossible to give any adequate picture
of the days which immediately followed. The
horror of them is still upon me as I write. There
are dangers which call out the best in man, which
arouse all his faculties to face and overcome
them; there are others that paralyze the arm
and numb the brain and stupefy the soul. The
danger before us was of this latter class. For
an hour after I entered that room and learned
the situation I sat dazed and stolid, and my men
were in no better condition. We were hopeless.</p>

<p>It is said you can become accustomed to anything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Possibly that is why my companions at
length began to stir and speak. It was their reproaches
that aroused me. “Why had we not
fought the enemy on the deck of the <i>Martha</i>,
and ended our lives there, instead of foolishly
surrendering her, and dying here in this foul
pen?” they were saying. They did not hesitate
to throw the blame on me. Stung to the quick,
I sprang to my feet. I threw off the lethargy
I was in, and I said resolutely:</p>

<p>“Comrades, do not be unreasonable. You
know I acted for the best when I surrendered
the <i>Martha</i>. I did as any other wise commander
would have done under the same circumstances.
Let us suppose we had fought; some of us would
have survived the conflict and been thrust in
here to meet the same foul conditions. Can we
tell which of us it might have been? Would we
have been any better prepared to face the situation
than now? Here we are all well and strong.
Let us arouse ourselves. Let us do for these
suffering men around us all we can do. Not
every one who has the smallpox dies with it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
Let us face this foe as we would any other, and
endeavor to conquer it; and if we do go down
before it, let us die as we would on a ship’s deck—like
men, doing our duty for ourselves and
others.”</p>

<p>I did not have to make a second appeal. A
ringing “Aye, aye, sir!” followed my speech,
and then the lads crowded about me asking what
they should do.</p>

<p>“First, we’ll find who these suffering men are
and how we can help them,” I answered. “Then
we’ll see if we cannot clean up this foul pen,
and make it more habitable. The disease will
not rage so severely where there is no filth, I’ve
been told; and it may be I can prevail upon the
prison authorities to furnish us with clean beds
and proper medical attendance. Rest assured
I’ll do all I can to bring about a better condition
of things here.”</p>

<p>“That you will, sir,” they responded, and
turned with me to attend to the sick ones about
us.</p>

<p>As I had expected, we found them all Colonial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
prisoners. Some had been there for weeks,
others like ourselves were newcomers. Two
weeks before one of their number had come
down with the smallpox, and the case had been
promptly reported to the prison officials. The
only thing that had been done by them, however,
was to put a man in charge of the room
who was an immune, and to bury the dead—for
four of their number had already died from the
disease.</p>

<p>I found the only thing we could do for the
present was to place the suffering men in easier
positions, and moisten their parched lips with
the scanty supply of water at our command.
But later, when the turnkey came—an old fellow,
deaf and gruff and indifferent to our condition—I
appealed to him to ask the superintendent
of the jail to furnish us with implements for
cleaning up the room, and with clean clothing
for the sick, and with medical care.</p>

<p>He demurred, saying: “They won’t do nothin’
for ye. They’d rather ye’d die here like rats
in a hole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Then I grew angry. “Tell him,” I exclaimed,
“that there is an officer in here who is not going
to die with the disease, and as sure as he lives
the home government shall know. Yea, the
whole civilized world shall know how he is treating
men whose only fault is that they are prisoners.”</p>

<p>There must have been something in my looks
or tones that startled him, for he shuffled away
down the corridor, and going to the prison officials
made known my demands, repeating word
for word what I had said. The result was we
were furnished with shovels, brooms, pails and
water in abundance, and before night our quarters
were clean.</p>

<p>A week passed, however, without any of my
other demands being met. Six more men died,
and were wrapped in their blankets, and carried
away to their burial. Ten more of the men had
come down with the contagion. The time was
fast approaching when the disease might be expected
to appear among my own crew. We
needed everything—beds, clothing, better and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
more food, and medicine. In my desperation I
grew cunning. From a piece of wire I found in
the possession of one of the men I manufactured
a key, with which I could unlock our door.</p>

<p>I knew it only allowed me to enter the outside
corridor, but even that circumstance I believed
I could use to our advantage. Our turnkey was
in the habit of communicating with us by a small
opening in the door. In fact, the door had been
thrown wide open but once since we had entered
the prison—the day we had cleaned the
room, and then four soldiers, all immunes, had
stood in the passageway with loaded muskets
to prevent our escape. Usually, however, the
attendant came to the door alone.</p>

<p>With this fact in mind, near the noon hour I
unlocked the door and waited. As soon as I
heard the footsteps of the old man outside, I
suddenly threw the door open, and sprang out
upon him. He was so surprised I had no difficulty
in catching him by the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Now lead me to the office,” I demanded.</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t go there, sir,” he cried in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
alarm. “I’m told not so much as to let you into
the corridor. You’ll give the disease to the
officials and the other prisoners.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I propose to do,” I retorted,
shaking him as a terrier would a rat.
“If we are not given clean beds and clothing
and medicine, we’ll tear this building down inch
by inch; we’ll scatter the germs of the smallpox
on the air. Some of us may die in the attempt,
but not until we have infected the whole town.
So lead on or I’ll throttle you!”</p>

<p>My loud voice and his equally loud remonstrances
reached the ears of the superintendent,
as I had intended they should, and he now
peeped into the corridor to see what the trouble
was. Catching enough of my words to comprehend
both my demands and my threats, he called
out:</p>

<p>“Don’t come down here, sir! Let the turnkey
go, and I’ll do what you say. The things shall
be sent you at once.”</p>

<p>I looked doubtfully at him. “I don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
whether to believe you or not,” I then said
slowly.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my word. I’ll send men at once
with the things, and they’ll bring your old ones
away, and burn them. Only go back into your
room and stay there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try you this once,” I finally decided, releasing
the turnkey. “But mark you, if you
fail me, there’ll be the hottest time in this old
jail you ever saw. We can get out of the room
when we please, and as I said, we may die in
the attempt, but it will not be until we have
exposed lots of you to the foul disease from
which we are suffering,” and I went back into
the room.</p>

<p>He kept his word in part. The clean beds
and clothing were brought, but we received no
medical care or supplies, and so the next morning
I repeated that part of my demand.</p>

<p>“The superintendent told me to tell you that
he was trying to find a physician for you,” the
attendant said tremblingly, “but so far every
one in town has refused to come here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>Another week passed. Eight more of the lads
had ended their sufferings, and seven new cases
of the disease had developed—among them
three of my own men: Midshipman LeMoyne,
Quartermaster Mohyes, and Elias Bowden, an
old sailor.</p>

<p>Of the original prisoners—those in the room
at our coming—there were only six surviving,
so terrible had been the ravages of the scourge
among them. Would there be as great a loss
among my crew? I feared it, and though at
that time of my life I was not much given to
prayer, I now prayed:</p>

<p>“O, Lord, spare my men. Send us help in
some way. We are in sore need.”</p>

<p>Over and over again I repeated the words,
and in some way they gave me great comfort.
I felt the help was coming, but I acknowledge it
came in a way I little expected. The next morning
there were hurried feet along our corridor,
then the door suddenly swung back, and the
funniest little Frenchman I ever saw popped in.</p>

<p>Short and fat, and dressed in the height of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
fashion, he bowed repeatedly first to one, then
to another of us, all the while talking in a
strange mixture of good French and poor English.
Between it all we made out that he was
Doctor Jean Vignor, who had landed in the town
the previous day. Learning by the merest accident
of our situation, he had deemed it a great
privilege to volunteer his services for our relief.
The prison authorities had consented, and there
he was to take the cases in hand.</p>

<p>“The leetlepox is nothing,” he declared with
a majestic wave of the hand. “I have the
remedy to cure, and the remedy to stop it;” and
then he began to examine his patients.</p>

<p>He went from one to the other, nodding his
head approvingly to some, and shaking his head
seriously at others, and administering medicine
to all. When the round was made, he came
to me, whom he seemed to recognize as chief,
saying:</p>

<p>“I cure him, and him, and him, and him,”
pointing out the men as he spoke; “him and
him and him I no cure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>With a heavy heart I noticed that the three
whom he had designated as beyond the reach
of his healing powers were my own comrades.
He now did what seemed to me a strange thing.
He made every well man among us march up
before him, and lancing a place in the arm he
rubbed in a thick fluid which he took from a
small vial in his case.</p>

<p>“You have not the pox now, or else have it
light,” he explained. “My friend Doctor Jenner
of London is what you call experimenting
with it. Some day it will make him famous.
He calls it vaccine.”</p>

<p>I now know he had vaccinated us—a common
thing today, and a discovery which, as the
Frenchman predicted, has made Doctor Jenner’s
name well known the world over—but we
had never heard of the process before, and
could not appreciate its value then as we did a
little later.</p>

<p>So droll was our new friend that he cheered
our hearts; so well did he seem to understand
the dread disease with which he battled that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
inspired our confidence; so strong was his influence
with the prison authorities that he secured
from them whatever he felt his patients
needed; so completely did he transform our
prison life that it seemed as though the sun
had come out from the thick clouds and was
sending its healing beams upon us. The only
sadness that came to me while he was with us
was the death of the three comrades whose cases
he had at the very outset pronounced incurable.
Even then he did all he could to comfort me,
and obtained permission from the officials for
me to accompany them to and mark their graves.</p>

<p>Of the remainder of our crew three did not
have the smallpox at all—William Goss,
Richard Webber, and myself—due, Doctor Vignor
said, to the great sores which formed upon
our arms. The others had the disease, but so
lightly they were scarcely indisposed.</p>

<p>“It’s the vaccine,” declared the physician.</p>

<p>“Then you should proclaim your remedy to
the world,” I insisted.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “That is my friend’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
work,” he explained. “He told me of this, and
I will not steal his honor. In due time he will
give it to the world.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>In a month the last case of the disease had
disappeared, and our room had been thoroughly
cleansed and fumigated.</p>

<p>“It’s time for me to go,” our good friend
now announced, “and I wish I could take you
all with me.” Then lowering his voice he added:</p>

<p>“I go to your country to be a surgeon in your
army. I’ll tell them of you, and have them arrange
an exchange.”</p>

<p>About the first of June I thought he had accomplished
his desire, for a British officer came
to our room, and looking us all over, asked our
names, and the station in which we had served.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“Arthur Dunn, William Goss, and Richard
Webber are to come with me.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that is all who are to go?” I
questioned, reluctant to leave a single man behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“It is all who are to go now,” he replied
curtly. “The others may be sent for later.”</p>

<p>Thus reassured we, the fortunate three as
we thought, bade our comrades good-bye, and
with exultant hearts followed the officer from
the room. Once in the street, he led us down to
the wharf where a yawl was in waiting.</p>

<p>“Get in,” he commanded, and, still thinking
that we were to be taken to some vessel where
our exchange was to be effected, we obeyed with
alacrity.</p>

<p>The men at the oars pulled us off towards a
large frigate well out in the harbor. Soon we
were where I could obtain a good view of her.</p>

<p>“The <i>Saint George</i>!” I exclaimed, recognizing
the frigate on which I had served as a midshipman
before the war with the colonies. Then,
too, like a flash it dawned upon me that my comrades
and myself were not to be exchanged;
but were to be pressed into the English naval
service.</p>

<small>I REJOIN THE BOSTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I glanced at my comrades and the expression
on their faces showed that they had recognized
the significance of my exclamation, and like
myself had surmised the fate in store for us.
But there was no time for us to speak to each
other or to protest with our captor for the next
moment we touched the side of the vessel, and
received the per-emptory order to mount to
her deck.</p>

<p>I do not know what the thoughts of my companions
were, but as for myself I was wondering
if there would be any of the old officers or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
men on the frigate. If so, would they know
me? And if I were recognized what would be
the outcome? Would I be regarded as a deserter,
and receive a deserter’s punishment?
The thought was not a pleasant one, and I confess
that as I stepped over the railing of the
craft I glanced apprehensively about me.</p>

<p>The first man my eye fell upon was the officer
of the deck, and who should he be but my old
acquaintance Midshipman Seymour, though he
now held the rank of a lieutenant. But if he
recognized me he gave no sign of it. Walking
over to us as though he expected and had prepared
for our coming, he took a notebook from
his pocket, and, referring to it, called out:</p>

<p>“William Goss!”</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” the sailor answered, though with
evident reluctance.</p>

<p>“You are assigned to the mizzen-top-mast
crew, to the starboard gun, number four, and
are in Lieutenant Grant’s watch,” he announced,
referring again to his book. “You
may go forward and report to the officer there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
He will see that you have your equipment, and
are shown your station.” Then he glanced at
his notes again.</p>

<p>“Richard Webber!” he now called.</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” the owner of the name responded,
because there was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>“You are assigned to the fore-topmast crew,
to the larboard gun, number ten, and are in my
watch. Go forward and report to the officer
there.”</p>

<p>Before he called my name he stared hard at
me, but I met his gaze without flinching. Then
he read:</p>

<p>“Arthur Dunn!”</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” I replied promptly.</p>

<p>“This is singular,” he remarked, and eying
me again. “I never expected to see you again
on this ship, but the fates have ordered otherwise.
Your case is so remarkable, sir, I must
take you to the captain,” and he led me down
to the cabin.</p>

<p>As I went I remember wishing that the commanding
officer might not be Captain Rawlins.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
He had been so kind to me when I first boarded
the frigate, and in fact during all the time I
was upon her, I did not care to receive my
sentence from his lips. I preferred to have an
entire stranger pass judgment upon me.</p>

<p>My desire was gratified. A man I had never
seen before sat at the table, but as he turned
his face towards me I knew I could expect no
mercy from his hands. Cold, stern, relentless,
cruel—those were the characteristics I read
there, and with the feeling that I had again
fallen into a hard place, I paused before him.</p>

<p>“This is the young man I was to bring down
to you when he arrived, sir,” Lieutenant Seymour
said.</p>

<p>The officer turned and stared at me.</p>

<p>“Your name?” he then demanded brusquely,
and I knew that it was only a matter of form.</p>

<p>“Arthur Dunn,” I confessed.</p>

<p>“You were once a midshipman on this
frigate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And ran away to join the enemy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“I hardly think that is a fair way to put it,”
I began, when he interrupted me.</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t. No deserter ever did
think his case was put fairly,” he exclaimed
with a sneer. “To my mind there is but one
thing to do with men of your stamp—it is to
hang them to the nearest yard-arm. And I
would do it, were there not a special order out
from the Naval Board for you to be sent back
to England if apprehended, where you are to
be made an example. So you are safe, so far
as your life is concerned, until you get there.
But we’ll manage to make that life as miserable
for you as it well can be,” and he grinned as
though the thought was pleasing to him.</p>

<p>Then to the waiting lieutenant he said:</p>

<p>“Take him forward, sir, and see that he has
half rations, double work, and double watches.
If he rebels, give him twenty blows with the
cat; and if that doesn’t tame him, give him
forty,” and again he gave that satanic grin.
Master Seymour also laughed, and I knew he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
had received an order he would delight to carry
out to the letter.</p>

<p>In the forecastle I found quite a number of
men I knew, but with the exception of old Pete
Berry they greeted me with jeers. It was clear
that they had no love for one whom they regarded
as a deserter, and I was confident that
in them the captain would find the tools he desired
to make my stay on shipboard anything
but agreeable.</p>

<p>I shall not weary the reader by relating here
the many and repeated insults I received, by
telling the hard and disagreeable tasks to which
I was assigned, by recounting the lashes which
without any provocation on my part were put
upon my back. I had not been on board the
ship a week before I knew my only hope was
to escape from the clutches of my tormentors.
I simply abided my opportunity.</p>

<p>The following week an incident happened
which at the time seemed to me to close every
opportunity I might have had to escape, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
which really proved to be the link in the chain
which was to give me my freedom.</p>

<p>The frigate had sighted and chased an American
privateer. She was apparently nearly
overhauled, and our bow gun was ready for the
firing. Then I was brought forward, and the
command was given me to aim, and touch off
the cannon.</p>

<p><a id="blows"></a>“And mark you,” Lieutenant Seymour, who
gave the order, continued, “if you miss the
craft, you shall receive forty blows from the
cat.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better give me the blows now,”
I replied resolutely, “for I will not aim or
fire a gun at my countrymen, not if I die for it.”</p>

<p>There was no time just then to use the lash,
so I was hurried off to the brig, and confined
there until the battle with the sloop-of-war was
over. They did not forget me, however, and
possibly the escape of the Continental vessel
after a slight brush with them added to the
spite which was put into the blows I received.
With back lacerated and bleeding, and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
part of my body quivering and aching in sympathy,
I was thrown back into the brig with the
assurance that I should lie there until the ship
was in port.</p>

<p>The next morning I was delirious with the
fever from my sores, and, perhaps fearing I
might not be in a condition to turn over to the
home officials when we arrived in London, the
ship’s doctor was sent to me. He took me in
hand to such a good purpose that in a few days
I was myself again, save the scars on my back.
But they still thought the brig the best place
for me, and left me confined there. It was then
I gave up all hope of effecting my escape, and
began to speculate on what would happen when
I was handed over to the Naval Board.</p>

<p>Another week passed, and one night my
guard was a marine named Blinn, with whom
I had scarcely spoken. I was surprised therefore
when he unlocked the door of the brig, and
stepping quickly in closed it behind him. His
first words surprised me even more. He said
in a low whisper:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“You know my brother, Thomas Blinn?”</p>

<p>“I rather think I do,” I answered. “He is
one of my best friends—we were midshipmen
together on two vessels, the <i>Franklin</i> and the
<i>Boston</i>. He is on the latter now, over in France,
I presume.”</p>

<p>“Across in France, you mean,” he corrected,
“as we are now in the English Channel.”</p>

<p>“Well, across in France, if you prefer; it
makes little difference,” I replied.</p>

<p>“It makes lots of difference, if you wish to
escape,” he went on eagerly. “We are becalmed,
in a thick fog, and there is a boat out.
It was put out this afternoon to fix something
that was wrong in the anchor chains. The men
didn’t finish their job, and so the yawl was left
there, side of the vessel until morning. Pete
Berry told me about it, and he says you and I
can slip into her, cut her loose, and cross over
to the French shore.”</p>

<p>Then, that I might understand better his reason
for leaving the ship, he added: “Like my
brother, my sympathies are with the colonies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
and I have been trying for nearly two years
to get away from the vessels I have been on,
but the opportunity has never come until now.
Listen while I tell you what you are to do.</p>

<p>“Go down this passageway to the farther
end, where you will find a door opening into the
forecastle. You are to slip in there, and stay
until the watch changes. When the new watch
goes on deck you are to go up with them, and
conceal yourself under the truck of the bow gun.
Remain there until Pete comes to you.
He will tell you what to do next.”</p>

<p>“And where shall I find you?” I queried.</p>

<p>“I shall be in the boat before you are,” he
answered confidently. “The new guard will be
here in a few minutes, and when I have placed
my musket in the rack, I shall go forward for
a little turn in the fresh air before I seek my
hammock. Once on the bow I shall find a way
to get into the boat. Don’t worry about me,
but do just as I have told you, and in an hour
we shall be free.”</p>

<p>Reasoning that I could be no worse off if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
I failed in the attempt, I followed him out into
the passage, and then crept softly down it.
Reaching the door, I opened it and entered the
forecastle. Some of the men were awake, but
they took no notice of me in the semi-darkness,
and, throwing myself into an empty hammock,
I waited for the next watch to be called to the
deck.</p>

<p>The summons came almost immediately, and
unnoticed I clambered up to the deck with the
other sailors. It was so dark I could not see
two feet away, and thus favored I made my way
forward to the bow-chaser under which I
quickly concealed myself.</p>

<p>The time I lay there seemed very long; in
reality it was but a few minutes. Then someone
touched my arm, and I hastily arose to find
Pete Berry beside me.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Silently I followed him, and he led me over
to the starboard side of the craft and put my
hand on the rope which led down to the yawl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“Go down,” he said again in the same low
tone, “but wait two minutes till I jine ye.”</p>

<p>It was the first intimation I had that the old
sailor was going along too; but I had a greater
surprise when my feet touched the boat, for I
found there three men instead of one. The
additional ones were my comrades, Goss and
Webber.</p>

<p>I could have hugged them in the ecstasy of my
joy at this discovery, for the one misgiving I
had in the whole plan was whether it would
be right for me to run away and leave them
behind. Putting off, however, that joyous expression
for a safer moment, I waited impatiently
for Pete to join us. He came in the
specified time, bringing quite a large package
with him.</p>

<p>“It’s our rations,” he explained as he drew
his knife and cut us adrift.</p>

<p>Rapidly the boat fell away from the frigate,
and she was soon lost in the fog. In a half-hour
we deemed it safe to put out our oars. All night
long, by turns, we pulled away, and when morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
dawned we estimated that we had made at
least ten miles.</p>

<p>As the sun came up the mist lifted enough for
us to make out a brig coming directly towards
us, and at her masthead were the stars and
stripes. The moment I caught sight of that
flag, I leaped to my feet, waved my hands, and
shouted at the top of my voice. My comrades
followed my example, and in a few minutes we
had the satisfaction of seeing that we had attracted
the vessel’s attention.</p>

<p>Down she came and rounded to us. The next
moment we were on her deck to find she was
the <i>Britannica</i>, a prize of the <i>Boston</i>, in command
of Midshipman Thomas Blinn, and bound
for L’Orient, where she was to await the coming
of the frigate.</p>

<p>Our story, long as it was, was soon told, and
then Master Blinn related the history of the
<i>Boston</i> since I had left her. Her passage across
the ocean had been made without mishap, and
on March thirty-first she entered the river of
Bordeaux. April first she weighed anchor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
ascended as far as the town Lavmoon, which
she saluted with thirteen guns, and where she
lay until the next morning. She continued up
the river to within three miles of Bordeaux,
where she landed Master Adams. There the
vessels had been thoroughly overhauled, and
left for a cruise across to the banks of Newfoundland,
looking for prizes. A number had
been captured on the westward voyage and sent
into Boston. Returning, the <i>Britannica</i>, bound
from Newfoundland to Oporto, and loaded with
seventeen hundred quintals of fish, had been
taken. Midshipman Blinn with a crew of six
had been put on board, with orders to precede
the frigate to L’Orient.</p>

<p>We arrived at that port July third, and two
days later the <i>Boston</i> came in. I went on board
at once, and made my report to Captain Tucker.
He was kind enough to say:</p>

<p>“I do not see how you are at all to blame,
Master Dunn, for the loss of the ship you commanded.
An older and more experienced officer
would hardly have done differently under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
circumstances. As for the experiences which
came later, they were beyond your control, and
you are in no way responsible for them—unless,”
he added with a smile, “we except your
second runaway from the <i>Saint George</i>, and for
that you will doubtless have to answer to the
British authorities, if they ever catch you
again.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>WE CAPTURE THE POLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>During the month that now followed two interesting
events took place. The first was the
sale of all the prizes which had been sent into
French ports, and the distribution of the money
among our crew. I had supposed that Masters
Goss and Webber and myself would not share
in this distribution, as we had not been in the
frigate when these vessels were captured. But
the decision was that every man on the ship’s
roster was entitled to his proportionate part,
and so we, who had just returned from captivity,
each received a tidy little sum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>The other event was the re-organization of
our crew. Our first lieutenant had died from a
wound he received by the bursting of a gun, so
Master Welch was now advanced to the first
place, Master Bates to the second, and Master
Livingstone was sent down from Paris to fill
the vacancy thus made, that of a third lieutenant.
A young man named Philip Forrier was
appointed midshipman in the place of Master
LeMoyne, who had died at Halifax.</p>

<p>There was a more radical change in our noncommissioned
officers, and an enlistment of a
number of new men, including Master Blinn and
old Pete Berry, who had escaped from the
<i>Saint George</i> with me. This gave us a total
crew of one hundred and forty-six men and
boys, exclusive of our officers, and exclusive of
our marines, of whom we had a full company.</p>

<p>The re-organization completed, on August
first we put to sea again, this time homeward
bound. For three weeks we sailed on our
course, catching sight of but two vessels during
the whole time, which were too far away for us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
to overhaul. Then our fortune changed and
during the next week we captured a prize every
day—all of which were manned with prize
crews, and ordered to follow in the wake of the
frigate.</p>

<p>The fleet made a fine spectacle, if I do say it,
and there was an amount of prize money represented
there to rejoice every sailor’s heart. Yet
with the most of us I do not think that was the
first thought. As good patriots we rejoiced that
we were bearing home stores which would help
to sustain and clothe an army of as true and
faithful men as ever fought for home or native
land.</p>

<p>I was put in command of the last prize, the
brig <i>Sally</i>, bound from London to Pensacola,
and having a cargo consisting of one hundred
barrels of flour, two hundred bags of bread,
one hundred and thirty-nine tierces of beef,
three hundred barrels of pork, seventy firkins
of butter and a large lot of liquors.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able to write that I took the
craft safely into port, and had but one incident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
out of the usual order. We were experiencing
quite a gale, and some of the sailors had been
ordered aloft to reef the top-sails. One of them,
Richard Jones by name, in some way lost his
hold and came tumbling down head-first. As I
saw him coming I was confident he would strike
upon the deck and be killed. But just before
he struck the brig lurched, and, clearing the
larboard rail, he went overboard.</p>

<p>Knowing he could not swim, I ordered Quartermaster
William Atkins, who was acting as
my first officer, to heave to the vessel, and send
out a boat. Then, throwing off my coat and
boots, I plunged into the sea.</p>

<p>Rising to the surface I looked around for
Master Jones, and caught sight of him a few
fathoms away. He disappeared before I could
reach him, and treading water I waited for him
to re-appear. He came up for the last time,
only a few feet away, and catching him by the
collar I struggled to keep him above the waves
until the boat could arrive.</p>

<p>Night was fast falling; the storm was increasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
in violence; and the waves rolled so high
that I was unable to see the vessel or the boat
which I was sure had been lowered. Master
Jones was unconscious, and hung a dead weight
upon my arm. It was difficult to keep him and
myself on the surface, and already I felt my
own strength was fast failing. Unless the
rescuers came soon we must both go down.</p>

<p>Then there came a faint shout across the
water to cheer my heart, and to which I responded
in the loudest tones I could utter. I
was heard, and the yawl, which had been going
in quite another direction, turned and came
towards me.</p>

<p>I kept crying out at intervals, and the lookout
in the bow of the boat answered, the double
cries serving to nerve me to hold out on the
one hand, and to guide the craft to me on the
other. At length they were beside me, and,
nearly exhausted, I was drawn on board with
my unconscious burden.</p>

<p>Then we tried to see where the brig was, but
between the great waves and the darkness she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
was concealed from our view. Taking the direction
we felt sure she was in, the four oarsmen
pulled long and lustily against wind and waves
and yet she did not appear. We had about concluded
that we had lost her, when her lights
suddenly appeared on our starboard, and we
were able to hail her. In five minutes we were
under her lee, and then were quickly drawn to
her deck.</p>

<p>Dry clothing and a warm drink soon brought
me to the place where I felt as good as new; but
they had to work over Master Jones for half
an hour before he came to consciousness, and he
could not leave the forecastle until the following
day. I have related this incident here not to
glorify myself, but to say that it was the only
act of mine that ever received a reprimand from
Captain Tucker.</p>

<p>“Your motive was all right, Master Dunn,”
he admitted, “and your plunge overboard to
save one of your men was a grand exhibition
of courage. But what if you had lost your life,
or your boat had failed to return to the brig?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
She would have been left in a crippled condition,
and might not have survived the storm.
Do always all that you can to save a man who
falls overboard without endangering your ship,
but remember that the ship and her cargo are
solemn trusts, and the lives of many are to be
considered rather than the lives of the few.”</p>

<p>But if he did not appreciate the deed, there
was one who did. When Master Jones came
on deck, he walked directly to me, and touching
his cap, said:</p>

<p>“I owe you my life, sir, an’ it’s yours. I not
only thank ye for what ye did for me, but I’ll
do my best to make it good some day, sir,” a
promise he faithfully kept.</p>

<p>We reached Boston October fifteenth, and
while the frigate was being overhauled, the captain
and I got a chance to run down to Marblehead
for a brief stay. Our coming created
something of a sensation this time, as it had on
the occasion of our previous visit, though for
different reasons. The captain’s prowess had
preceded him and his fellow townsmen were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
proud to have him with them again; for myself,
they had heard I had died of the smallpox in the
Halifax prison, and were filled with curiosity
to know how I came to be alive and well and in
my old place on the ship.</p>

<p>Before the month was over, however, we were
off to sea again, and during the next six months
made such havoc among the enemy’s shipping
that a price was put on Captain Tucker’s head.
If I recollect rightly, we took a score of merchantmen
with large and valuable cargoes, and
two frigates, the <i>Glencairn</i> of twenty guns and
the <i>Thorn</i> of eighteen.</p>

<p>Early in June, 1779, we went on a cruise to
the West Indies which lasted until the following
September. During this trip our prizes
were so numerous, the British admiral at New
York selected the frigate <i>Pole</i>, carrying thirty-two
guns, and over three hundred men, and sent
her out for the special purpose of finding and
destroying the <i>Boston</i>, or as her Captain expressed
it: “Of giving that rebel Tucker a
sound drubbing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>We learned of this fact through the captain
of the packet <i>Sandwich</i>, which was captured off
the Bermudas. Chagrined at the loss of his own
vessel, the moment he mounted to our deck, the
officer exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you have taken my vessel, but let
me tell you it will not be many days before you
yourself are captured.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” Captain Tucker questioned
with a smile. “Pray tell me who is going to
do it?”</p>

<p>“The frigate <i>Pole</i>,” he returned boastingly.
“She has been fitted up and sent out on purpose
to look you up and give you a sound drubbing.
I heard her captain say he’d do it. She left
New York four days ago, and must be down in
this region by this time. Your cable is pretty
nearly paid out.”</p>

<p>“Cannot you tell me more about her, so I may
know her when I see her?” asked our commander
tauntingly. “I might want to run
away.”</p>

<p>“That will do you little good,” the Englishman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
replied, taking our skipper seriously. “She
is bigger than you are, and carries eight more
guns. She also has twice as large a crew, all
picked men, and in addition a large body of
marines. Besides that, she is the swiftest sailer
on this side of the ocean, and can run you down
in no time.”</p>

<p>“It does look as though I’d find her more
than a match, doesn’t it?” our Captain remarked
soberly. “She’s a good thing to avoid.
I’m much obliged to you for your information.
One thing more, please. You are quite sure she
is somewhere between here and New York?”</p>

<p>The prisoner bit his lip. It had dawned upon
him that possibly he had been talking too much.
His information might enable Captain Tucker
to escape capture. Finally, however, he answered:</p>

<p>“The frigate left New York, as I have said,
four days ago; you must judge for yourself
where she is now.”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll run up that way and take a
look at her,” was the Captain’s comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>Two days later we sighted a frigate, and Captain
Tucker knew her at once by the description
he had received. Sending for the commander
of the packet, he pointed out the distant
vessel, saying:</p>

<p>“There is your frigate. Now I want you to
stand here, and see how I run away from her.
But mind, not a word from you to thwart my
plans.”</p>

<p>Then he ordered the English colors hoisted,
and ran down towards the vessel. As soon as
he had come within speaking distance, the English
captain hailed him:</p>

<p>“What ship is that?”</p>

<p>“Captain Gordon’s,” replied our Captain, for
he knew that Captain Gordon commanded an
English ship, modelled and built much like the
<i>Boston</i>, and had been unusually successful in
taking American prizes.</p>

<p>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p>“From New York.”</p>

<p>“We are from there also.”</p>

<p>“When did you leave?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“About six days ago. I’m after the frigate
<i>Boston</i> to take that rebel Tucker. I’ve sworn
I’ll earn the price set on his head, and am
bound to carry him dead or alive into New York.
Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined Captain Tucker, “I have
heard of him. They say he is a hard customer.”</p>

<p>During all this conversation, he had been
quietly manœuvering to bring his ship into a
raking position, so as to sweep the decks of the
English frigate. He had every man at his post,
his guns shotted, and his gunners with lighted
matches in their hands all awaiting his orders.</p>

<p>But it happened that there was a man in the
maintop of the <i>Pole</i> who had formerly known
Captain Tucker, and he now cried out to the
English captain:</p>

<p>“That is surely Tucker himself, and we shall
have a hot time here directly!”</p>

<p>This was overheard by our commander, and
having got his ship into just the position he
wished, and seeing that he was discovered, he
gave the order:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Down with the English flag and hoist our
own colors!”</p>

<p>Then he called out to the British captain in a
voice of thunder:</p>

<p>“The time I proposed talking with you has
ended, sir. This is the <i>Boston</i> frigate. I am
Samuel Tucker, and no rebel. Either fire or
strike your flag!”</p>

<p>Observing that his antagonist had all the advantage
of him, and that a broadside would be
fatal, the Britisher struck his colors. Not a gun
was fired.</p>

<p>Later, when the commander of the <i>Pole</i> came
on board of our ship, and went below to the
stateroom assigned him, he shed tears to think
that he had been captured by a vessel not so
large as his own, and with only half as many
men, and eight less guns. It is also reported
that on his release and return to England he
was tried and disgraced for this surrender.</p>

<p>Quite in contrast with this was the treatment
given our Captain on his arrival in Philadelphia
with his prize. Her capture added to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
prowess, he received a vote of thanks from Congress,
and, owing to her superior size and equipment,
her entire value of one hundred and three
thousand pounds sterling was turned over to us
as prize money.</p>

<p>Probably, however, the most disgusted man
on board the captured frigate was the captain
of the packet <i>Sandwich</i>, who had given us our
first news about her, and who had boasted she
would speedily capture us. He had been a
silent witness of her ignominious surrender.
Then Captain Tucker had sent him on board
of her, with instructions that each day while we
were on our way to port, he was to be conducted
all over her, from bow to stern, and from lower
hold to upper deck, and then he was to be told:</p>

<p>“This, sir, is the vessel which was specially
fitted up and sent out to look up the frigate
<i>Boston</i>, and give her captain a sound drubbing.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>TO THE DEFENSE OF CHARLESTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>After two weeks in port we sailed again, this
time making a cruise to the northward. We
reached the neighborhood of Halifax before we
found a prize, and then captured a small brig.
Learning that she was a part of a convoy, consisting
of the frigate <i>Elizabeth</i> of twenty guns,
the brig <i>Observer</i> of sixteen guns, and the sloop-of-war
<i>Howe</i> of fourteen guns, and that there
were under their protection two large ships with
cargoes of great value, Captain Tucker determined
“to make capital,” as he expressed it,
and sailed to intercept them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>The next morning they were sighted, and
hoisting the English colors we sailed boldly into
their midst. Selecting the heaviest armed ship,
we came up with her and hailed her:</p>

<p>“Are you the frigate <i>Elizabeth</i>, from Antigua
bound to Halifax?” was our Captain’s query.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer. “What ship are
you?”</p>

<p>Instead of replying directly, Captain Tucker
answered:</p>

<p>“I’ll come on board.”</p>

<p>He had already laid his plans. Fifty men
under the command of Lieutenant Bates were in
readiness to board her. To them and to the
helmsman a set of special signals was given,
and specific directions as to the part they were
expected to play in the coming struggle. Then
the first signal was given, and as if by accident
the <i>Boston</i> ran afoul of the <i>Elizabeth’s</i> yards.
Pretending it was the fault of the helmsman,
Captain Tucker called out:</p>

<p>“Brace about there, sir,” but at the same
time he gave his second secret signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>The sailor at the helm saw it, and in obedience
to that rather than to the spoken command, only
entangled the vessel with her antagonist more
and more, and soon was in close contact with
her.</p>

<p>Seeing all was ready, our skipper gave his
third signal, and a waiting sailor ran down the
English flag and hoisted the stars and stripes.
Then in stentorian tones came the command:</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>But the English captain had now discovered
our real character, and both vessels fired a
broadside at the same time. The moment the
terrible roar of the artillery ceased, however,
the fifty picked men leaped on board the <i>Elizabeth</i>.
Like the rush of a whirlwind they swept
her deck, drove her crew down below, and hauled
down her colors. These movements were seen
by the <i>Observer</i>, and she came down to attack
us. But Captain Tucker cried out in a threatening
voice:</p>

<p>“We are ready for you, sir, two to one.
Come on!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>Our men already had control of the <i>Elizabeth</i>,
and turned with our frigate to attack the newcomer.
Finding she had got to face the guns of
two vessels instead of one, the brig thought discretion
the better part of valor, and attempted
to run away. A broadside poured into her
quickly changed that plan, however, and she
ran down her flag.</p>

<p>The sloop-of-war <i>Howe</i>, supposing her consort
was going to fight, had ranged up towards, and
now fired upon us. Whereupon Captain Tucker
shouted:</p>

<p>“Captain Frazer, if you fire another broadside,
I’ll blow you out of the water. Surrender!”</p>

<p>The captain of the sloop evidently thought it
prudent to do so, and obeyed the command. It
was an easy matter for us then to pick up the
two ships, and we took all five of the vessels
safely into port.</p>

<p>In November we were back again in Philadelphia,
where we received orders to put our frigate
into thorough order for a special service.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
While this work was going on there was much
speculation among us—the younger officers of
the ship—as to the character of this mission.
But we did not know until the beginning of the
following month what was really expected of
us. Then Captain Tucker received this official
order:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“Philadelphia, December 15, 1779.</p>

<p>To Captain Samuel Tucker,<br>
<span class="indentleft">Commanding the frigate <i>Boston</i>.</span></p>

<p>Sir:—You are hereby directed to put to sea
in your ship at the earliest possible moment, and
proceed with all despatch to Charleston, South
Carolina, where your vessel will join the fleet of
Commodore Whipple, now gathering there for
the defense of that town. On your arrival there
you will take all further orders from him.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright4">By order of</span><br>
The Naval Committee.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reason for this order was already known
to us. Sir Henry Clinton, taking advantage of
the withdrawal of the French fleet under the
command of Admiral D’Estang from Savannah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
in the previous October, to the West Indies for
winter quarters, had despatched a large land
and naval force from New York to besiege that
town. Rumors were already multiplying that
its fall was certain, and would be followed by
an immediate attack on Charleston. Hoping to
save the latter place Congress had directed General
Lincoln, who was in command of the Continental
army in the south, to hasten to its defense,
and meantime was collecting a fleet there
to aid the land forces.</p>

<p>In five days we were ready to sail, and on
Christmas day entered the harbor of Charleston.
In order for the reader to understand the events
which transpired there during the next three
months, it will be necessary for him to have certain
facts clearly in his mind. He should remember
that the town lies on a neck of low
land, a peninsula, formed by the junction of the
Ashley and Cooper rivers, whose confluence
makes a harbor two miles wide, and seven miles
long, facing south-east to the ocean. The width
of the Ashley river at its mouth is about twenty-one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> 
hundred yards, and the width of the Cooper
not far from fourteen hundred. Down the harbor,
and bounding it on its sea side, are the
Sullivan and James islands, the former being
the site of Fort Moultrie, and the latter that
of Fort Johnson.</p>

<p>At the time of our arrival the British had not
yet appeared, but during the next five weeks
they came in constantly increasing numbers,
until there was a land force of ten thousand
men, and a naval force consisting of a ship of
fifty guns, two of forty-four guns each, and
four of thirty-two guns each, besides numerous
transports and smaller vessels, ranging from
six to twenty-four guns.</p>

<p>To oppose these formidable forces General
Lincoln could rely upon only fifteen hundred
regular troops, and such militia as could be
drawn from the surrounding country—in all
less than four thousand men; while the armed
vessels numbered five: the schooner <i>Providence</i>,
Commodore Whipple’s flagship, mounting
eighteen guns; the frigate <i>Ranger</i>, Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
Thomas Sampson, carrying twenty-four guns;
the frigate <i>Boston</i>, Captain Samuel Tucker,
with twenty-four guns; the frigate <i>Queen of
France</i>, Captain John Peck Rathbone, with
twenty guns; and the state brig, <i>Notre Dame</i>,
with twelve guns.</p>

<p>To check the advance of the enemy up the
harbor our ships were stretched across the channel
between Fort Moultrie and Fort Johnson,
while in the former garrison there was a force
of three hundred picked men, and in the latter
one hundred.</p>

<p>Up to the first of February, though there had
been some slight skirmishing, the British still
remained in the outer harbor, while we held
possession of the inner harbor and the town.
But early in that month active operations were
begun to dislodge us, or compel our surrender.</p>

<p>Early one morning our lookout forward
noticed that all of the British transports and
some of the men-of-war were hoisting their
anchors, and preparing to sail. He reported
his discovery to the officer of the deck, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
promptly notified Captain Tucker. He came up
from the cabin, and signalled the movement to
the Commodore, who sent a man into the cross-trees
of the flagship to watch the enemy. When
the departing vessels had disappeared behind
Morris island, Commodore Whipple ran up a
signal for the <i>Boston</i> to send out a yawl to
watch the mouth of Wappoo creek, and in case
the British attempted to land in that vicinity
to announce the fact by firing three swivel guns.
He added:</p>

<p>“I will send a boat along with yours.”</p>

<p>I was put in command of the yawl from our
frigate, and Lieutenant Haines had charge of
the boat from the <i>Providence</i>. His superior
rank made him commander of the expedition,
and together we proceeded down the creek to
its mouth, and, lying to there, waited for the
coming of the English vessels.</p>

<p>Soon they appeared below Morris Island, but
instead of rounding it, and sailing up our way,
they kept straight on down the coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“What does that mean?” asked Lieutenant
Haines, turning to me.</p>

<p>I studied the situation for a moment or two
before I replied. Then I said:</p>

<p>“They are going farther down the shore to
land. They know if they come up here our
vessels can put themselves into a position where,
if they do not prevent the landing, they can
make it a terribly costly thing to undertake.
But dropping a few miles down the coast, they
can land without any interference from us. We
haven’t a sufficient land force to send a part
down there to stop them. The ships they have
left in the lower harbor are enough to prevent
our fleet from following them, and there isn’t
water enough for our craft to slip out this back
way. So they can take their time, and disembark
the troops without fear of being disturbed
by us.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right,” the lieutenant responded.
“Sir Henry Clinton has got his thinking
cap on at last. Well, this is so different from
what our Commodore expected I will send you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
back to report. Meantime I will follow the
enemy down the shore.”</p>

<p>“And shall I return to you with the new orders?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if there are any.”</p>

<p>Up the creek and down to the flagship I went
as fast as a dozen stout arms could pull the
yawl. Commodore Whipple was at the railing
when I reached the side of the vessel, and returning
my salute, said:</p>

<p>“Report right where you are, Midshipman.
What have you discovered?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Haines presents his compliments,
sir,” I began, “and desires me to say
that the British ships are going on down the
coast, and in his judgment are seeking a landing-place
where we cannot follow them or send
down a land force to prevent them.”</p>

<p>“I surmised as much,” answered the Commodore
with a smile. “It is what I should do,
if I were in charge of those forces. Has Lieutenant
Haines gone down the coast to keep
watch of them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“I beg your pardon, sir,” I replied. “I
should have reported that also, and he wishes
to know if you have any new orders?”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” he directed, “and I will
send down to you a day’s rations for the lieutenant
and his men. Then you may go over to
your own frigate and provision your own boat
similarly, and return down the shore. When the
enemy have effected a landing, one of your
boats may come back to tell me where it has
been made. The other may remain to watch
the movements of the red-coats.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” I replied and gave my men
the order to pull away.</p>

<p>In a short time I had secured the rations, and
was on my way to rejoin Lieutenant Haines. It
was noon before I overtook him, or rather his
boat. I found that pulled on the north side of
John’s Island, thirty miles below Charleston,
but the lieutenant was not with his men.</p>

<p>“The British are landing on the other side,”
the boatswain in charge explained, “and Lieutenant
Haines is over there watching them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>In about an hour he came back.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said as he caught sight of me, “I
thought it was about time for you to be here,
and they sent down our rations? I expected it.
We’ll have dinner right away, and while eating
it I’ll tell you what I have seen.”</p>

<p>Kindling a small fire on the beach, we made
some coffee, and were soon stowing away our
food with the hearty appetites a keen air had
created.</p>

<p>“The British are landing in a small cove almost
opposite this, and not over a mile away,”
the officer said, between his mouthfuls of food.
“As soon as a regiment is landed, it crosses
over to the main shore and goes into camp. It
will take them some hours to complete the task.
We’ll go over again after a while.”</p>

<p>Two or three hours later he announced that
he was ready, and together we made our way
through the woods to the south side of the
island. Before we reached there we could
plainly hear the sounds of the disembarking,
and my comrade remarked in a low tone:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“They are not through yet.”</p>

<p>We were soon where we could see all that
was going on, and there we lay for a long time
watching the constantly changing scene. It was
night before the last company was landed, and
the order was given for the empty transports
to return to Charleston harbor under the escort
of the attending men-of-war.</p>

<p>“We may as well return to our boats,” the
lieutenant now said, rising and leading the way
back through the underbrush. When at the
cove, he continued:</p>

<p>“You made the first report. I will make this
one, while you and your men remain here to see
what movement the red-coats make in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I assented, and then stood there
watching until his yawl had been lost in the
darkness which was fast falling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>TAKEN INTO THE BRITISH CAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I stood there, as I have said, watching the disappearance
of Lieutenant Haines’s boat, but I
was also listening. During my conversation with
him I was quite sure that I had heard a stealthy
step in the woods back of me. Doubtless someone
from the camp of the enemy had discovered
and was now watching us. If so, they must be
apprehended, but how?</p>

<p>Debating this question in my own mind without
acquainting my companions with my suspicions,
I gave orders to prepare our camp for
the night. Our yawl was drawn out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
water, and carried a few rods up from the shore.
There it was propped up by stones some two
feet above the ground. Thus it furnished a
good roof for a temporary cabin, whose sides
were constructed from brush brought from the
edge of the forest. In front of this we kindled
a small fire and began our preparations for supper.</p>

<p>While my men were completing these arrangements,
I walked over and stood under a
huge tree, whose limbs overhung the beach. Ostensibly
I was overseeing the work that was
going on in camp, but in reality I was straining
my ears to catch every sound which came from
the woods behind me. It was just there I believed
I had caught the sound of footsteps, and,
if I was not mistaken, the intruder was still lying
within a few feet of me. My plan was to detect
if possible his attempt to depart, and then follow
him.</p>

<p>I did not have so long to wait as I expected.
Before the meal was ready I heard the concealed
man arise to his feet, and move softly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
back into the woods. Quickly stepping over to
where Boatswain Lewis was busy directing the
men, I explained to him in a whisper why I left
the camp, and then glided in among the trees in
pursuit of the Britisher.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in locating him. As soon
as he had gone a few rods away from the shore,
he seemed to think he was beyond the reach of
our ears, and now moved on regardless of the
noise he was making. Moreover, instead of going
across the island, he had turned and taken
a short cut for its west end. These circumstances
enabled me to overtake him rapidly, and
I was soon dodging along from tree to tree close
behind him.</p>

<p><a id="shore"></a>He soon came out upon the shore, opposite
the British camp, where a boat and four men
were evidently awaiting him. To them he said
in tones loud enough for me to hear:</p>

<p>“I have found the rebels’ nest, my lads. But
one boat with its crew has escaped us, having
gone back up the coast, to report the landing of
the troops, I presume. The other is there, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
intends to stay until morning to keep watch of
Sir Henry’s movements. They are, however,
too many for us, and we’ll, have to cross over
to the camp for help. Later we’ll return and
capture the whole bunch. Pull away.”</p>

<p>While he was talking his comrades had been
getting the skiff ready for their departure, and
his last words were uttered as he took his seat
in the craft. Slowly it glided away towards the
mainland, and, baffled in my attempt to obtain a
prisoner, yet thankful I had discovered his design
upon myself and men, I turned to retrace
my steps to camp.</p>

<p>It was easy for me to conjecture the character
of the departing men. They were Tories who
had probably seen our boats go down the coast,
and, suspecting our purpose, had followed.
They would report our presence to the British
commander, and he would send over a force before
morning sufficient to capture us. It was
clear that we must change our camp immediately.</p>

<p>I therefore quickened my pace, and soon rejoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
my men, to whom I made known my discovery.
Finding they had put off partaking of
their supper until my return, I now gave orders
for the meal to be eaten. Then we tore down
our temporary structure, launched the boat, and
proceeded with muffled oars up the shore to the
northwestern corner of the island. Here we
again landed, and simply carrying the boat up
a few feet above tide water, turned it over,
raised one side a few inches, and crawled under,
making ourselves as comfortable as possible under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>I chose this place for our second camp for
two reasons. It was but a short distance above
the spot where the force sent to capture us
would be likely to land, and I argued that it was,
therefore, the last place where the enemy would
expect to find us; then, as it was on a narrow
point, curving to the west and south, it would
enable us not only to overlook the British encampment
on the main shore, but to see the
crossing and landing of the red-coats when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
came in search of us. My choice, however,
proved to be a disastrous one, at least for me.</p>

<p>It must have been near the midnight hour before
we saw any movement which indicated the
enemy were coming our way. All my men, with
my permission, had gone to sleep except Boatswain
Lewis, and it was he who at length called
my attention to a few lights moving slowly down
the edge of the narrow strait which separated
us from the British encampment. We watched
them, and in the flicker of their lanterns counted
at least three score men as they embarked in
four boats, and put out from the shore.</p>

<p>“They are coming in strong force,” I remarked
to my comrade in a low tone. “They
must count us desperate fellows.”</p>

<p>“We’d whip them now in a fair fight,” Master
Lewis growled, “but to have that number
come down on us when we weren’t looking for
them is another thing. It’s lucky you discovered
their plan, sir, and we got out of their
way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“Two of the boats are coming up the
strait,” I announced a moment later. “Can
it be they are going to land here?”</p>

<p>“If so, we’ll have to run,” was the boatswain’s
laconic comment.</p>

<p>All our attention was now given to these two
boats, and in preparation for their possible
landing I aroused my men. Rapidly and almost
noiselessly the yawls came up towards us, but
instead of attempting to land, they rounded the
point and went on down the north side of the
island.</p>

<p>Master Lewis nudged me. “See!” he exclaimed
in a whisper. “They are sent down to
cut off our escape from the water side. The
red-coats don’t mean to give us a chance to get
out of their clutches.”</p>

<p>“But look there, sir,” another of my men
cried out almost aloud, and before I could
answer Master Lewis. “The land force has
divided, and a part of them are coming up this
way!”</p>

<p>A single glance told me he was right. Upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
landing, the enemy had separated into two
squads, one going down through the woods,
doubtless to approach our old camping place
from the south and east sides; while the other
was following the shore, to make an attack from
the west. I immediately thought of Master
Lewis’s declaration: “The red-coats don’t
mean to give us a chance to get out of their
clutches.” They certainly had planned to hem
us in from all sides, and would succeed if we
did not move promptly. So I gave the command:</p>

<p>“Quick, lads! Launch the boat! We must
get away from here at once.”</p>

<p>They knew this as well as I did, and obeyed
with alacrity. The next moment they had lifted
the yawl and were carrying it down to the
water’s edge. The boats of the enemy were
already below us, and could we get off the shore
before the land force discovered our proximity,
there was still a chance for us to slip away unnoticed
in the darkness. I believe we should
have done it but for an accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>It was quite dark, and in our haste we had no
time to pick our way. One of my men struck
against an obstacle, and stumbling, fell to the
ground, pulling the boat and two or three of his
companions down upon him. The mishap not
only made a noise which reached the ears of the
coming squad, but broke the unfortunate fellow’s
leg. He struggled vainly to regain his
feet, and then sank back with a groan.</p>

<p>But he did not forget the danger we were in.
Had he done so, the yells of the red-coats as
they quickened their steps to overhaul us, would
have reminded him of it. Heroically he cried:</p>

<p>“Leave me, sir! There’s time for you and
your men to escape.”</p>

<p>But that was a thing I would not do, even if
we were all captured; and to their credit I will
say there was not a man among us who would
have done it. Instead six, at my order, picked
up the boat and hurried to the water with it,
while the others raised their injured comrade
and hastened after them. I closely followed.</p>

<p>The steps of the coming British sounded dangerously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
near, but we worked calmly. The yawl
was launched; the suffering sailor was laid
gently in her; the men took their places; and
all but Boatswain Lewis and myself had embarked.</p>

<p>“Step in, sir,” he said. “I’ll push the craft
off.”</p>

<p>“No,” I commanded, “get in yourself. It is
my place to be the last.”</p>

<p>I said this, for I knew the enemy were almost
upon us, and hoped to save my men, if not
myself. He obeyed, just as a pair of stout
hands clutched my shoulders and their owner
cried:</p>

<p>“Not so fast, my young gander; we’ll keep
you with us a while longer, I reckon.”</p>

<p>I did not attempt to resist him. I spent all
my strength to push off the yawl with my feet.
A vigorous kick sent her gliding off from the
shore.</p>

<p>“Away, lads!” I shouted. “You know where
to go and what to do,” and then I was borne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
down to the ground, and at least a half dozen
red-coats held me down.</p>

<p>Several of the squad followed our boat into
the water in their zeal to capture it, but my
men were too quick for them, and rowed it beyond
their reach. Then the Britishers hallooed
for their own boats to return, and give chase
to ours. By this time they had allowed me to
regain my feet, and I again called out:</p>

<p>“Never mind me, lads! Make good your own
escape, and finish the work I have left undone.”</p>

<p>“Aye! aye! sir!” came the answer across the
water, and I knew Boatswain Lewis had heard
and understood my command and would complete
the task assigned to me of reporting the
movements of the British army.</p>

<p>I received a blow across my mouth from the
officer in charge of the squad for my act, accompanied
with the surly words:</p>

<p>“Shut your mouth, you young puppy! But
for your kick and bark we might have captured
your boat and crew. I only hope the General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
will regard you as a spy and hang you to the
nearest tree.”</p>

<p>His boats had come back up the shore, and
now at his order went on in the darkness, hoping
to overhaul my comrades—a thing I am glad
to say they were not able to do. He then despatched
a messenger down the island to intercept
and recall the other land force. These matters
attended to, he surrounded me with his
men and marched off to the place where he had
landed. When the other squad rejoined him, he
gave the command to return to the camp. There
I was placed in a tent, in use as a temporary
guardhouse, and surrounded with soldiers who
kept watch over me until morning. At an early
hour they carried me into the presence of General
Clinton.</p>

<p>“So you are the Yankee spy my men captured
last night?” he demanded sternly.</p>

<p>“I hardly see how you can call me that, sir,”
I answered as pleasantly as I could. “I was not
taken in your camp.”</p>

<p>“Do you deny that you were watching my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
movements in order to report them to the commander
of the rebel forces?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I do not,” I replied, “but I have not
been inside of your lines, and have never intended
to come inside of them. I am simply the
commander of a boat sent out by our Commodore
to watch your landing—an act I believe
that makes me a prisoner of war now that I am
so unfortunate as to be captured, but not a spy.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he now questioned.</p>

<p>“Midshipman Arthur Dunn, of the frigate
<i>Boston</i>,” I responded, knowing of no reason
why I should conceal my identity.</p>

<p>“Oh! ho!” was his quick ejaculation. “I believe
there is another frigate on board of which
they will be glad to see you. Since you have
deserted her twice, you may not find it hard to
recall her name. She will be in New York by
the time I get back there. I am told her commander
has an order from our Naval Board to
hang you to the nearest yard-arm. So I’ll keep
you and turn you over to him. He can do what
I perhaps could not legitimately do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>I was taken back to the guardhouse, where I
was given a frugal breakfast, and then put
under the care of an officer and six men, who
were given strict commands to shoot me down
at my first attempt to escape.</p>

<p>The troops were already breaking camp, and
all day long I marched with them as they proceeded
up the coast towards Charleston. At
night, when they again went into camp, I was
remanded to the guard tent, where, regardless
of the number of men they put over me, I threw
myself on the ground, and, worn and weary,
sunk into a deep slumber. I was too tired to
make any attempt to escape.</p>

<p>How long I slept I do not know, but I was
awakened by hearing a voice, which I felt sure
belonged to Lieutenant Haines, demanding an
immediate entrance to my tent. His demand to
my surprise was quickly granted, and the next
instant he stood before me, clad, as I could see
by the light which came through the doorway
from an adjacent campfire, in the uniform of an
English officer. Holding up his hand to check<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
the exclamation which had risen to my lips, he
said sternly:</p>

<p>“Young man, the General wishes to see you
at once. Follow me!”</p>

<p>I arose and followed him out by the guards,
who made no attempt to stop us. Once in the
open air, he quickly led me into the shadow of
some trees, and whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>“Not a word, now, sir. I’ll explain everything
later. Put on these clothes over your
own,” and he took from the bosom of his own
coat the uniform of a British soldier. It took
me but a minute or two to comply with his request,
and, having donned the disguise, I stalked
along after him towards the nearest outposts.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE BEACON HOUSE LIGHT EXPEDITION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I had supposed that my guide knew some unguarded
spot along the edge of the great forest
beside which the camp had been pitched, and
would slip out unnoticed there. But instead he
led me straight down to the picket who held
the outpost on the road leading up to Charleston.
To his per-emptory challenge he answered:
“Friendly,” and at the command gave
the countersign: “King George.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Captain Aylesworth,” the
man said. “I recognized you at once, but I
had to obey orders. I was told to let no one
in or out of the camp without the password.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“And by it proved you were a good soldier,”
the supposed captain replied pleasantly. “This
is the other attendant I told you I had returned
for. I find the special business I am on needs
another helper. I will vouch for him.”</p>

<p>So I was allowed to pass with the officer, and
in a few minutes we were beyond the reach of
a recall.</p>

<p>“Tell me now, Lieutenant Haines, how you
came to be here, and arranged so successfully
the plan that has given me my liberty,” I said.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Master Dunn,” he replied, turning
into a side path which led towards the sea.
“Wait until we are safe in my boat.”</p>

<p>A half mile farther on we came out upon a
small creek. A shrill whistle from the lieutenant
brought an answering whistle from down
the stream, and in a moment his yawl came up
to the bank. As it reached us the boatswain
flashed out a dark lantern, and I noticed the
craft held two prisoners—one dressed in the
lieutenant’s garb, and the other wrapped in a
blanket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“Captain Aylesworth,” my conductor now
said, addressing the officer, “your uniform and
that of your attendant have served my purpose
well, and my friend, as you see, is with me.
We will now exchange our clothing, and you
and he are at liberty to return to your camp.”</p>

<p>The Englishman bowed stiffly, and without a
word resumed his own uniform. The soldier
as quickly donned the garments I gave him, and
then the two hurried away by the path down
which the lieutenant and I had so recently come.</p>

<p>We did not stop to watch them, but, stepping
into the yawl, glided rapidly down the creek to
its mouth. Once out on the ocean our bow was
turned to the north, and as twelve strong arms
pulled us along, Lieutenant Haines told his
story:</p>

<p>“When your boat, under the impetus of your
vigorous kick, glided away from John’s Island,
it was the intention of your boatswain to put
in somewhere along the main shore, and still
keep watch of the movements of the British
army. But the sufferings of the injured sailor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
led him to change his plan, and he decided to
return immediately to the frigate.</p>

<p>“He arrived there in the morning, and his
report of your capture filled your captain with
consternation.</p>

<p>“‘The lad will give his right name,’ he said,
‘and they’ll recognize him as a runaway from
the <i>Saint George</i> and likely as not will hang
him; or else they will regard him as a spy,
though he was not caught within their lines, and
string him up to the nearest tree. We must
act quickly, or we cannot save him.’</p>

<p>“So he took the boatswain and came right
over to the <i>Providence</i> to see the Commodore.
I was present at the interview, and assure you
that Master Lewis gave a glowing account of
how you discovered the prying Tory, learned
his purpose, and planned to thwart it. He grew
even more enthusiastic when he related how
you would not leave your injured man, or allow
him to be the last one on the boat, and, though
captured yourself, pushed him and his comrades
out of the reach of the enemy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“Did he tell you what a fool I was to make
my second camp at the head of the island?” I
interrupted. “If I had only gone over to the
main shore, as I should have done, I should not
have made such a mess of the affair as I did.”</p>

<p>“Your movement was a perfectly natural
one, and such as I should have made had I been
there,” he returned warmly; “and, though the
enemy did come upon you in such overwhelming
numbers, and surrounded you on every side,
you would have escaped but for the accident
to your man—a thing you could not help.
That’s my view of the matter, and also the
Commodore’s for he said:</p>

<p>“‘A lad who can stand by his men like that,
Captain Tucker, has the making of a hero in
him. He’s worth saving;’ and then he turned
to me:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="p2701_ill">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p2701_ill.jpg" alt="He soon came upon the shore">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">He soon came upon the shore, where a boat and four men were
evidently awaiting him.</p>

<p class="right">(p. <a href="#shore">253</a>)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“‘Lieutenant Haines,’ he said, ‘get ready
your boat and return to the British encampment.
Seek an interview under a flag of truce with
the British general. If you find he intends to
hang the boy, assure him that I shall hang two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
British officers in his place, one of whom is his
own nephew. If he is willing to make an exchange,
tell him I will give him two men of
equal rank for the lad, or one of superior rank—his
nephew, if he wishes. We’ll let him know
he cannot treat his young prisoner lightly.’</p>

<p>“In fifteen minutes I was off. The British
troops, as you know, had moved up this way,
and I reached them during their noon halt.
Taking two of my men with me under a flag of
truce, I asked for an interview with the commander.
It was granted me, but I was never
more coldly received. To my proposition for
an exchange the general said haughtily:</p>

<p>“‘Tell your commander I would not exchange
the midshipman for himself.’</p>

<p>“To my threat he answered with a cruel
laugh:</p>

<p>“‘I know who my prisoner is, and why you
are making such an effort to secure his release.
Twice he has escaped our hands, but he shall
not again. I want the satisfaction of seeing
him hung, and hang he shall, though your commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
strings up a dozen men in his place.’</p>

<p>“Of course, I knew nothing more could be
done with so obdurate an officer, and left the
camp. But right here let me say if you ever
again fall into the hands of the enemy, don’t
give your right name. There seems to be a
general order out for your apprehension, in
both the army and navy.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” I assented, “and for that reason
I appreciate all the more what you have done
for me, Lieutenant Haines. But how did that
come about?”</p>

<p>“In the simplest way,” he continued.
“Though I left the camp, I did not leave the
vicinity of the army. Going back to my boat,
I kept along the shore, moving about as rapidly
as the troops did, and when they stopped for
the night, I ran into that creek where we found
my boat. Again, taking two men with me, I
went up near to the outposts, looking for an opportunity
to rescue you. I was all the more
determined to do this because the General had
declared you should not escape again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“Well, the opportunity came sooner and in
a better way than I had anticipated. While
my men and I were lying in a thicket waiting
for the darkness to fall, we heard voices. Soon
two men came up the road, and I heard one say:</p>

<p>“‘You are sure, Tom, that you know the
way?’</p>

<p>“‘Never fear about that, Captain Aylesworth,’
the other replied. ‘I can take you to
Colonel Nutter’s plantation on the darkest
night. It isn’t over two miles from here, and
we’ll be there in time for you to take supper
with his family.’</p>

<p>“I am, as you may know, a South Carolinian,
and at once recognized the name of Colonel
Nutter as that of a rank Tory and a leader of
the Tory forces in this part of the colony.
Doubtless he was a personal friend of this Captain
Aylesworth, who, finding himself near his
residence, was going to make him a visit.</p>

<p>“No sooner had I thought of this when there
flashed into my brain a plan by which I was certain
I could secure your liberty. Motioning my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
men to follow me, I kept on the trail of the
two men until we were well away from the
camp. Then we sprang upon them. Taken by
surprise, we had no trouble in effecting their
capture, and bringing them down to my boat.</p>

<p>“There I made the captain change uniforms
with me, and took that of the soldier along for
your use when I should find you. Then I returned
to the lines. As soon as it was dark
enough to conceal my face, I approached the
nearest guard, with some misgiving I admit,
yet determined in some way to pass him. When
he challenged me, I replied:</p>

<p>“‘I am Captain Aylesworth, who passed you
an hour or two ago.’</p>

<p>“‘I remember,’ he answered, ‘but you had a
man with you then.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I agreed, ‘and I’ve got to have
another, and so have returned for him.’</p>

<p>“He allowed me to pass, but I was not a
dozen feet away when he called out abruptly:</p>

<p>“‘The password, sir. You’ll have to give
that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“Here was a poser. I did not know what it
was, but I did not want to go back, so I started
to parley with him.</p>

<p>“‘King George hasn’t a more loyal supporter,’
I began to say but had only uttered
the first two words, when to my delight he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“‘That’s it, sir; you may go on,’ and on I
went.</p>

<p>“It took some time to locate the tent you
were in, and the half dozen men about it did
not look very promising for your release. But
again bold effrontery served me well. Walking
straight up to the guard at the door, I told him
the General desired another interview with you,
and had sent me to conduct you to him. The
uniform I wore was his assurance that my demand
was genuine, and I was admitted to your
presence. I am now wondering what the General
will say when he finds you are gone,” and
he finished his tale with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“It is useless for me to thank you for what
you have done for me tonight,” I began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“That is what I think,” he responded with
a laugh, “so I wouldn’t say anything about it.”
Then he added with intense feeling: “Arthur
Dunn, the red-coats have burned my home over
the heads of my aged father and mother; they
have slain my only brother—a lad of your age,
and of whom you remind me. In return for
this, I have sworn that I will do them all the
injury I can. I know of nothing that will provoke
the British authorities more than your
escape, and that is all the compensation I
need.”</p>

<p>It was not yet midnight, and before the sun
rose I was again on board the <i>Boston</i>. As I
went over the rail, my own watch was in charge
of the deck, and at sight of me they broke into
three rousing cheers. The noise awakened
Captain Tucker, and learning the cause of it,
he sent for me. No father could have greeted
me more warmly, and almost his first words
were those Lieutenant Haines had spoken a
few hours earlier:</p>

<p>“If you again fall into the hands of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
enemy, don’t give your right name,” a bit of
advice I had already made up my mind to follow.</p>

<p>At the close of the following day the British
forces arrived at Wappoo Creek, near James
Island, and south of the Ashley River. Here
they began to throw up entrenchments and prepare
themselves for a siege. Their naval forces
at the same time drew a little nearer the inner
harbor, and formed a line across its entrance
so as to blockade it. They also took possession
of Beacon House Light, and put a small force
within it, and a frigate a few fathoms off shore
to protect it with her cannon. These movements
were a part of the spiral which during
the next two months they wove about the town
and which eventually hemmed it in.</p>

<p>From this time also there was continual
activity on land and water between our forces—now
and then a pitched battle, more often a
skirmishing, frequently a naval duel, constantly
an endeavor on their part to advance, and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
less constantly an effort on our part to check
them or to drive them back.</p>

<p>I shall write only of those incidents of which
I was a part. Possibly through Lieutenant
Haines, who seemed to have taken a great interest
in me, I shared in some of the more dangerous
undertakings, but I would by no means
have the reader think we were the only ones
who were doing anything. The fact is that every
man on land or sea was in service—every
soldier and every sailor was instant in season
and out of season during the days and nights
that now followed. I did not hear of a single
shirker, nor do I know of a case where anyone
in those days tried to favor himself. If there
was ever an army of heroes, the men under
General Lincoln deserved that title. If there
was ever a gallant naval force, the officers and
crews of our ships won the appellation over
and over again. The story never has been
told—nor can it ever be told—of what was endured
and suffered and done by that little army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
and smaller navy in their efforts to save the
town.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the British ships moved up the
outer harbor when Lieutenant Haines paid me
a visit. When we were alone in my mess-room,
he said in a low tone:</p>

<p>“Master Dunn, are you ready to go with me
on what may prove a perilous undertaking?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered promptly, and waited for
him to make such disclosures as seemed wisest
to him.</p>

<p>He smiled. “Your promptness does you
credit,” he continued, “but let me first tell
you the nature of my mission. The enemy have,
as you know, captured Beacon House Light,
and the Commodore has learned there was a
special reason for it. Some Tory friend has
furnished the British admiral with a chart of
the harbor—its channels and its courses—the
Beacon Light serving as a center from which
they take all their bearings. If the Light can be
destroyed now, their drawing, if not rendered
entirely useless, will at least not be so serviceable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
and so Commodore Whipple has asked me
to undertake its destruction. I have consented,
and on the first favorable night shall make the
attempt. I shall take fifteen men with me, and,
if you are ready to accompany me, will ask you
to take the same number.”</p>

<p>“I am as ready to go now as I was before
you told me what we were to do,” I declared.</p>

<p>Again he smiled. “I expected it, and yet let
me state wherein our peril lies. First, we must
have a dark, stormy night for the enterprise or
else we cannot get through the British fleet, and
we run the risk which naturally comes to open
boats in a raging sea. Then, should we pass
the fleet and overpower the men in the Light
and succeed in destroying it, we shall have an
aroused enemy to escape on our return. I regard
it as about an even chance for us to go
down to the Light undiscovered; but to come
back in safety the odds are all against us.”</p>

<p>“Still I shall go,” I asserted unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Commodore Whipple will speak to Captain
Tucker, asking that you be assigned to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
work, and I will then give you further details
of my plan,” the lieutenant added as he arose
to depart.</p>

<p>Two days later there came a storm from the
south-east. Before sundown the rain poured
in torrents, and the wind blew in great gusts.
As night came on it became so dark one could
not see a boat’s length away. It was the favorable
time for which we had been waiting, and
I was not surprised to receive word from Lieutenant
Haines to be ready to start at eight
o’clock.</p>

<p>When the hour came I was in the ship’s cutter
with my men awaiting the signal from the
<i>Providence</i>. My oars were muffled, and a dark
lantern was so arranged as to throw light only
on the compass by which I was to steer. Almost
immediately the signal came—a light flashed
three times over the schooner’s rail. I knew
that at that instant the lieutenant left her side,
but I could not make out his boat. It mattered
little, however; for by pre-arrangement, we
were to run through the British fleet in different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
courses, and, if the passage was successful,
were to meet at a little cove just north of the
Light. If one boat failed, the other was to
carry out the assigned task. So I gave the
command to my crew:</p>

<p>“Pull away, lads!”</p>

<p>The next minute we dashed away through
the rain and against the wind and tide upon
our perilous passage.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>WE BOARD A CARTEL SHIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In a short time I became convinced of two
things. First, that we would have no difficulty
in running through the British fleet unnoticed.
The storm was so severe every patrol boat had
been withdrawn; the darkness was so heavy we
could not be seen ten feet away; the wind and
sea made so much noise that whatever sounds
came from us would pass unheard. I dismissed
therefore all apprehension on this point immediately.
The other matter was more serious,
and soon became a struggle for life. It was
the battle with the storm. To pull against it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
took all the strength of my men; to keep the
yawl true to her course was an impossibility;
to prevent our craft from filling and sinking
took the united efforts of four of the crew.</p>

<p>We gained our way slowly. The lights of the
British vessels showed that. At length we were
among the upper craft, and guided by them,
I strove to swing back to the course from which
I had seriously deviated. The combined
strength of Boatswain Lewis and myself could
not hold our helm to its place. Twice we swung
dangerously near the enemy’s ships. Once we
passed directly under the stern of a frigate
but we were unseen and unheard. At length we
were clear of the fleet, and now the Beacon
House Light itself became our guide.</p>

<p>Two hours had been allowed in the arranging
of our plans for us to reach the little cove
where we were to make our rendezvous; four
had elapsed before we reached there, only to
find ourselves alone.</p>

<p>The agreement between Lieutenant Haines
and myself was that whoever arrived there first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
was to wait one hour for the coming of the
other party. But that had been on the supposition
that two hours were ample to make the
passage to the cove even against the storm.</p>

<p>It was now midnight, an hour later than I
would have waited had I reached the rendezvous
on time. Had Lieutenant Haines arrived
there, and, after waiting the allotted time, gone
on to the light house? I looked long and earnestly
towards the beacon, but there was nothing
in the shadows behind, or the rays in front, to
give me a definite answer. I confess I was
puzzled. I did not know whether to wait my
hour there, or to go on immediately to the
tower. I finally decided on the former course.
I would obey my directions to the letter.</p>

<p>Slowly the minutes passed—so slowly that
again and again I put my watch to my ears to
make sure it had not stopped. A half-hour;
another quarter had come and gone, and I was
overhauling the materials I had brought for the
destruction of the Light in case the sole responsibility
devolved upon me, when my ear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
caught the faint sound of oars. I listened, and
the sound was more distinct, then the lieutenant’s
yawl came out of the gloom and touched
the shore at my feet.</p>

<p>“Did you reach here, Master Dunn, without
capsizing?” were the officer’s first words.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Then you did better than I,” he responded,
and as he stepped ashore I saw he was as wet
as a drowned rat. His men were also in the
same condition.</p>

<p>“Our rudder broke just after we ran through
the fleet,” he explained, “and before we could
do anything to prevent it, the yawl broached to,
and shipping a ton or more of water, went over.
We lost one man, and the entire contents of the
craft except some extra oars which were fastened
inside. With much difficulty we righted
her, bailed her out with our tarpaulins, and,
crawling back into her, finally succeeded in
reaching here, but in a sorry condition to carry
out our assigned task. I am glad you arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
in better shape. How long have you been
here?”</p>

<p>“Nearly an hour, sir. I was waiting out the
allotted time before I went on to the Light.”</p>

<p>“That was right,” he said heartily, “for it
gives me a chance to share in the work. Five
minutes to one,” he added, glancing at his
watch in the light of my dark lantern; “not so
late as I had feared. There is still time to
complete our job and get back to our ships.”</p>

<p>“We shall have the wind and tide with
us, and can make our return much more rapidly,”
I suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, if the enemy does not prevent,” he admitted.
“But the moment the beacon is in
flames they will be on the alert for us, and
having fresh men at the oars may run us down.
We took that chance, however, when we decided
to come here.”</p>

<p>We now took the powder and oil cans from
my boat, and distributed them among our crews
to carry. Then ten of us with our hands free
to use our cutlasses placed ourselves at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
head of the squad, and we began our march
across the point to the light house.</p>

<p>This was a huge structure, built partly of
stone and partly of hard pine logs. The door,
fortunately for us, was on the rear side of the
building, and towards this we made our way.
Reaching it without discovery, we paused a
moment to listen. The lantern at the top of
the tower shone brightly, but all the rest of the
building loomed up darkly above our heads. No
sound came from within. The inmates, whatever
their number, were evidently asleep, save
perhaps the single watchman to care for the
lantern.</p>

<p>My own plan, had I come alone, was to force
open the door and seize the men within before
they could recover from their surprise. But
Lieutenant Haines had arranged to obtain by
ruse what I should have gained by force. Raising
the hilt of his sword, he pounded loudly on
the door. Twice he was compelled to do this,
and then a sleepy voice asked:</p>

<p>“Who’s there? What do you want?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Our boat is ashore. We want shelter for
the rest of the night,” the officer answered as
though he belonged to the British patrol.</p>

<p>“Aye! aye! sir,” came the response, “I’ll be
there in a moment.”</p>

<p>There was a shuffling of feet and then the
door was thrown wide open for us. Springing
in, we seized the attendant before he could
make the slightest resistance. There were six
other men, all in their bunks, and, though roused
by our entrance, they had no time to get their
weapons before we had made them prisoners.
Then the seven were taken down to our boats
under a strong guard, there to await our coming.</p>

<p>We were now ready for our work of destruction.
Tearing out a half dozen places in the
foundation of the building, we placed canisters
of powder within them. From these long
strings of oakum, well saturated with oil, were
carried to the center of the house. Here a huge
pile of combustibles was made, oil was spread
on walls and floors and stairs, the front windows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
were darkened to hide the flames from
that side, a rear window was left open for
draft—and all was ready.</p>

<p>Sending the men off to the yawls, the lieutenant
and I knelt down, and with flint and steel
started a blaze in the heap of combustibles.
Watching it until sure the fire was really kindled,
we slipped out the door and ran for the
cove.</p>

<p>There we halted and fastened our eyes upon
the burning building. Through the rear door
and window we could see the flames as they
gained headway. Across the floor, up the walls
they ran, and streaming out through the openings
threw a great glare upon the dark curtain
of the night. It was clear our work had been
well done, and the structure was doomed. Then
Lieutenant Haines turned to his prisoners, saying:</p>

<p>“Good sirs, we leave you here simply because
we have no room for you in the boats. Possibly
the nearest frigate will send a boat for you; if
not, you will be no more exposed to the gale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
than we are. One word of warning to you, however.
We have placed six kegs of powder in
yonder walls. It will, therefore, be well for you
to keep a long distance from the fire. Good-night,”
and with that he gave the order for us
to embark.</p>

<p>Our plan for the return was to keep near the
shore until opposite Sullivan Island, then dash
quickly to the south to enter the upper bay
through the passage between Morris and Sullivan
Islands. This course would enable us to
run before the wind for a large part of the way,
would keep us out of the glare of the burning
building, and would also make it impossible for
the enemy to follow us except in small boats.</p>

<p>For a short distance our boats kept together,
probably because we were all more intent on
watching the fire than we were in making our
escape. Soon there came an explosion, followed
in rapid succession by five others. Stones and
logs were tossed high in the air; the great tower
tottered and then fell with a crash which sounded
loud above the storm; sparks and embers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
flew in every direction; the flames burst out
anew as though they would devour everything
before them.</p>

<p>“She’s destroyed!” I shouted, but if the lieutenant
heard me he made no answer. I glanced
in the direction his boat had been but a moment
before, and saw that it had disappeared, lost
in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Give way, my lads!” I said to my own men,
and they obeyed with a will.</p>

<p>As we went up the bay I could see signs that
the enemy were aroused. Lights flashed to and
fro on the decks of the frigates. The one nearest
the Beacon House fired a cannon, and then
put out a boat which hastened to the shore.</p>

<p>“They’ll soon know the fire was not an accident,”
I remarked to my boatswain, “and may
attempt to follow us.”</p>

<p>“It will do them no good, sir,” he answered.
“We have too long a start for them to overhaul
us. Our fear is yonder as we cross out
to the channel. If I mistake not, one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
ships has hoisted her anchor, and is coming
up this way.”</p>

<p>I looked in the direction he indicated, and
saw by her rapidly moving lights that one of
the vessels had certainly cast off her moorings
and was running up the bay.</p>

<p>“We must reach and cross the channel before
her,” I declared. “Heave away, lads!”</p>

<p>“Aye! aye! sir!” they responded, and bent to
their oars.</p>

<p>Without waiting to go higher up the bay, I
had our helm changed to carry us out towards
Cumming’s Point. But fast as we went, the
ship came faster. It seemed also that she was
shaping her course to head us off.</p>

<p>“Run up under Sullivan’s Island,” I directed
Master Lewis. “If necessary, we’ll beach the
boat and seek protection in Fort Moultrie.”</p>

<p>He promptly turned our bow that way, and
the coming vessel changed her own course just
enough to follow in our wake.</p>

<p>“She must see us!” I now exclaimed in my
surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“It looks so, but I do not see how,” the boatswain
admitted in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>“Change again towards the point,” I ordered.</p>

<p>He did so, and again the ship turned. All the
while she had been gaining rapidly upon us, and
now was so near I was anxious lest she run us
down.</p>

<p>“Port! Port your helm!” I cried, hoping in
that way to swing clear of her. But we were
too late. I had only time to call to my men
to save themselves by springing upon her deck,
as she cut our yawl in two.</p>

<p>Following the advice I had given my men,
I leaped for her rail. She was not so large nor
so high out of water as she had seemed when
farther down the bay, and I caught the railing
and pulled myself up on her deck. Rising, I
shook the water from my clothing, and then
heard a voice near me say:</p>

<p>“I’m right along with you, sir.” It was Boatswain
Lewis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“So am I,” another and then another voice
exclaimed.</p>

<p>The same cry came from the larboard rail,
and I was sure that half of my men at least had
escaped the disaster—but escaped into the
enemy’s hands. To my amazement, however,
little attention was paid to us. Her officers
and men seemed too busy with the care of their
ship for that.</p>

<p>Standing near her foremast with my men, I
slowly took all this in, and came to the conclusion
that the craft had broken her anchor
chains and driven up the bay before the gale.
All her courses had been due to attempts to prevent
her wreck, and to get back to her anchorage,
and not to her efforts to follow me. In
fact, as I learned a little later, she had not seen
us at all, and had no idea we were in that locality
until she ran us down.</p>

<p>Soon an officer passed near us in the discharge
of his duties.</p>

<p>“Where is your captain?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>“On the quarter-deck,” he replied. “Who
are you?”</p>

<p>“One of the men you just ran down.”</p>

<p>“A Yankee officer?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the inner harbor?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Come with me.”</p>

<p>He led me aft to his commander, and in a
few words explained who I was and how I came
there.</p>

<p>“He says he knows the upper bay,” the subordinate
continued.</p>

<p>“I am Captain Jackson,” the skipper then
said. “This is the cartel ship, and we have
lost our anchors, leaving us at the mercy of
the storm. There are a number of refugees
on board, including several women and children.
For their sake the vessel must be saved.
If you can put us into the inner bay where we
can ride out the storm, or beach the craft in
safety, I will give you charge of her.”</p>

<p>I thought a moment. Then I answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“I believe I can bring you near enough to our
frigate for them to throw us a hawser, sir, and
you can then ride out the storm.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they will allow me to return
when the gale is over, or will consider me a
prize?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I cannot say what our commander will do,
sir,” I responded, “but if I were in command
of our fleet the character of your ship would
protect you.”</p>

<p>“I must take the risk,” he concluded, and
turned the wheel over to me.</p>

<p>I ran in behind Cumming’s Point for smoother
waters, and then took a straight course up
the bay past Fort Johnson. I could now see
the lights of the <i>Boston</i>, and headed directly
for her.</p>

<p>At my suggestion Boatswain Lewis was sent
into our bow to hail the frigate. In his powerful
voice he called out to her as we drew near,
proclaiming our character, and asking for a
rope. I had to luff to under her stern in order
to get it, but at length it reached us, and, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
ourselves fast, we held on there until morning.</p>

<p>I now took the opportunity to muster my
men, and found that all but four had succeeded
in clambering to the deck of the cartel ship.
The missing four turned up the next day. They
had clung to the broken boat and drifted ashore
on Sullivan’s Island. Lieutenant Haines
reached the <i>Providence</i> without further mishap.</p>

<p>After consultation with Commodore Whipple
the next day, Captain Tucker was able to inform
Captain Jackson that his vessel would be
allowed to return to the English fleet. He had
to wait twenty-four hours before the storm
had abated sufficiently to permit him to sail,
but when the hour came for him to depart, he
and his officers and passengers signed and sent
a letter of thanks to our commander for the
kindness shown them while in our lines.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>CHARLESTON IS TAKEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I know that Captain Tucker greatly appreciated
this act of Captain Jackson and his
friends, but he could not have been so elated
as were Lieutenant Haines and I over the
thanks we received the day after the departure
of the cartel ship.</p>

<p>Master John Rutledge, the governor of the
colony, sent for us to call upon him at his residence
in the town. When we were in his presence
he said:</p>

<p>“You, then, are the officers who were in command
of the squad that destroyed the Beacon
House Light?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>We bowed our assent.</p>

<p>“I have requested you to call here today, my
good sirs,” he continued, “that I may extend
to you personally my thanks for the very
efficient manner in which you performed your
task.”</p>

<p>We hastened to assure him we had only done
our duty.</p>

<p>“Admit that,” he responded with a smile,
“you nevertheless did your work so well you
deserve this acknowledgment from me. I am
glad one of you is a native of this colony, and
that the other is from the colony of Massachusetts.
It shows that the same intrepid spirit
is to be found in our patriots whether they
come from the north or from the south. It is
the hope of our final success in this struggle for
our independence.”</p>

<p>I know my own face flushed with pleasure at
his words, and I am equally sure that the face
of Master Haines did.</p>

<p>“I called you here, however,” the governor
went on, “not only to thank you for what you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
have done, but to ask you to do something
else.”</p>

<p>“We are ready,” we replied together.</p>

<p>“I wish you to destroy Fort Johnson,” he
said, and paused to mark the effect of his words
upon us.</p>

<p>We looked at each other. Both of us knew
why this request was made. The entrenchment
of the British at Ashley River and their erection
of batteries across Wappoo Creek had rendered
the fortification untenable. A three-sided
fort, with parapets only on the north and east
and west, it left the south—the side on which
the enemy had appeared—wholly unprotected.
So the commander had promptly withdrawn,
bringing away, however, his men, his guns, and
his stores in safety.</p>

<p>But for some reason, possibly his haste, he
had left the fortress intact, and now the enemy
were arranging to occupy it. Already a small
detachment of soldiers had been placed within
it, and cannon were on the way across the island
to re-fortify it. Once furnished with an armament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
the red-coats would be able to drive our
ships from their present station, and protect
their own vessels whenever they attempted to
enter the upper bay by the south channel. Its
destruction meant a continuation of our control
over the entrance to the inner harbor.</p>

<p>It was a very different undertaking from our
previous one—a place easier to reach; a work
harder to do; and one that would require a
much larger force of men.</p>

<p>Still, as I gazed into Lieutenant Haines’s
eyes, I knew he was willing to undertake it, and
I was as willing to accompany him as I had
been on the night we destroyed the Beacon
House Light. So we repeated together the
words we had already used:</p>

<p>“We are ready.”</p>

<p>“I will speak to Commodore Whipple about
the matter, then, and you will receive your orders
direct from him,” and he dismissed us.</p>

<p>Within an hour, however, the official assignment
reached us, and, since the undertaking
brooked no delay, we set about our preparations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
at once. When night came we were ready.
At ten o’clock eight boats, carrying four score
men, one-half of them armed with swords and
guns, the others bearing spades and bars and
mattocks, swung clear of the frigates, and
pulled across the harbor. Landing a few rods
above the fort, our working force was left on
the shore, while the others advanced upon the
unsuspecting garrison.</p>

<p>We reached its rear without challenge, and
with a rush entered. Out from the barracks
came a dozen half-clad and unarmed men, followed
in a few minutes by a dozen more who
had delayed to dress and arm themselves. But
at the sight of our overwhelming numbers they
quickly surrendered. The surprise had been
complete.</p>

<p>It now fell to my lot to take a dozen men
from our armed squad, and proceed a half mile
up the island, and form a picket line against
any possible surprise; while Lieutenant Haines
brought up our working gang and began the
demolition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>The parapets were thrown down, the stones
tumbled into the sea, the timbers drawn over to
the barracks for a general conflagration, the
dirt levelled. It was a long task, and a hard
one, and the morning hours were drawing near
when the huge pile of combustibles was ready
for the flames. Then my men and I were recalled;
the fire was kindled; and we hastened to
our boats.</p>

<p>We were not fifty fathoms from the shore
when a body of horsemen came tearing down to
the burning ruins. Fearful, perhaps, that we
might have placed cans of powder in the pile,
they did not attempt to stay the flames. Instead
they rode on down to the shore, where they
fired their pistols and sent after us their shouts
of derision.</p>

<p>Baffled in their attempt to make use of the
fort, the British now began more vigorous efforts
to hem us in. The land forces endeavored
to cross the Ashley River to the Neck.</p>

<p>This was no easy task, for General Lincoln
had by no means been idle. From the Ashley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
to the Cooper River he had thrown up a line of
redoubts, with a deep ditch in front; and every
vulnerable point on the shores and around the
town was fortified with cannon and detachments
of soldiers. He stubbornly contested,
therefore, every advance of the enemy, and
though they outnumbered his own troops nearly
three to one, it took them a month to obtain a
footing on the north bank of the river. But
at last it was accomplished, and, to our chagrin,
they completed a parallel line of batteries
within eleven hundred yards of our own.</p>

<p>Had our ships been free to aid our land
forces, I then thought, and even now I believe
the history of the siege would have been differently
written. But while Sir Henry Clinton
was conducting his troops across the river, the
British admiral moved up the bay with the design
of attacking us from the water side.</p>

<p>A question arose on our part as to the best
place to station our own ships for this attack.
Some of our officers favored our changing to
Five Fathom Hole, while others believed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
better position was between the islands. The
matter was settled by sending Captains Tucker
and Rathbone to get the soundings from the bar
to the hole. I was in charge of one of our boats,
and helped to frame the report which the captains
handed to Commodore Whipple. It was
substantially as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We find eleven feet of water in the channel
from the bar to Five Fathom Hole. The Hole
is three miles from the bar. Ships cannot
anchor until they are at that distance from the
bar. Off North Breaker Head, where the vessels
can anchor, they will be one and a half
miles from the shore.</p>

<p>“It would be useless to place batteries there,
for should the enemy make a retreat necessary,
it would be impossible for us to cover that retreat,
or to take the men away. It is clear,
therefore, that our ships can do the most effectual
service for the defense and security of the
town by acting in conjunction with Fort Moultrie.</p>

<p>“Our reasons are: that the channel is so narrow
between the fort and the middle ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
that they (the ships) may be moved so as to
rake the channel and prevent the enemy’s
troops from being landed to annoy the fort;
and will also be in the best position to check the
advance of the enemy’s fleet into the inner
bay.”</p>
</div>

<p>This report prevailed, and our little fleet remained
where it was—on line with Fort Moultrie.
This garrison was under the command of
Colonel Pinckney, an experienced and intrepid
officer, and every one of the soldiers with him
was a picked man.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the advance across the Ashley
begun by the troops when the British ships began
their advance up the bay. Arranged in the
form of an inverted V, the apex pointing up
the harbor, they came on. The moment it arrived
within gun range, the leading vessel
opened up a brisk fire; the other vessels in turn
followed her example. The fort and our ships
returned the fire, and the battle was on.</p>

<p>For an hour it raged. But wind and tide, as
well as the number and strength of the ships,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
was on the side of the enemy, and they at length
broke through our line, and were enabled to
attack us from the rear. To save our ships,
therefore, we were compelled to withdraw to
the mouth of the Cooper River, while the English
fleet anchored off the ruins of Fort Johnson
to repair their damages, which had been
severe.</p>

<p>The position they now occupied made it useless
for Colonel Pinckney to remain in Fort
Moultrie, so, abandoning it under the cover of
the night, he escaped with his men and his guns
to the Neck.</p>

<p>To prevent the fleet from coming up the
Cooper River and enfilading our lines, on the
next day we sank eleven vessels across the
river’s mouth, and stationed the <i>Ranger</i> and
two galleys north of the sunken craft.</p>

<p>The other ships were taken farther up the
river and dismantled, both men and guns being
transferred to the shore to re-inforce the batteries.
There was also a further addition to
our little army. General Woodford arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
with seven hundred men, he and his brave followers
having made a forced march of five hundred
miles in twenty-eight days for our relief.</p>

<p>But however bright the ray of hope was
which was awakened by their coming, it shone
only for ten days, for then the British were reinforced
by the arrival of two thousand fresh
troops from New York. About the same time
also they completed their second line of redoubts
within three hundred yards of ours;
their fleet advanced within cannon shot of the
town; and a heavy detachment of soldiers was
thrown across the north end of the Neck, completely
hemming us in. It was now the twentieth
of April—a day long to be remembered
by us, for on it we received our first summons
to surrender. To this demand the brave Lincoln
replied:</p>

<p>“As long as my men have food to eat, and
sufficient strength to endure the ceaseless toil
and vigilance required of them, I have no intention
of surrendering.”</p>

<p>Distress through the scarcity of food was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
not, however, long in coming. All supplies from
the country were cut off; the amount of stores
on hand was not large; and it was not long before
all classes had to be put on an allowance,
six ounces of pork and a little rice being each
one’s portion.</p>

<p>On May first famine stared us in the face;
only rations enough for one more week remained.
Our hospitals were overflowing with
the wounded; our death roll—due to our constant
skirmishing—had become frightfully
large; our men were becoming emaciated from
their scanty supply of food, and worn with
their unremitting toil and vigilance. Still, to a
second demand from the British general for
surrender, General Lincoln, after consulting
with his officers, returned a flat refusal.</p>

<p>Ten more days went by. The British troops
were now within twenty-five yards of our line.
For several days hot shot from the ships in the
harbor and the batteries on shore had been
thrown into the town, setting houses on fire in
several quarters. Our entrenchments were shattered;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
our garrisons were weakened by their
losses; our food was gone; our men had hardly
strength enough to make a firm stand against
a general assault, yet so intrepid was our
leader he decided to undertake one.</p>

<p>The last battle, the fiercest and most formidable
during the invasion, followed. Pouring out
from our redoubts at an unsuspected moment, we
swept down and upon the first line of British
batteries, striving to dislodge the red-coats and
drive them back to the second line of entrenchments.
It is not within my power to describe
the onslaught, for before I reached the batteries
a ball from a musket struck me in the
breast, and I went down, to be trampled under
the feet of my comrades as they rushed on in
their vain undertaking. For though the contest
raged long and fiercely, with terrible losses
on both sides, superior numbers finally told and
we were driven back to our redoubts, beaten,
but not conquered.</p>

<p>As night came on our commander called his
officers together again for consultation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
general feeling was that it would be useless,
yes, an unwise sacrifice of precious lives, to fight
longer, and so on the following day General
Lincoln secured terms of honorable surrender.</p>

<small>“THE CRUISE OF THE NINE”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I did not lie long there on the battlefield after
the struggle was over. Some of my comrades
had seen me when I fell, and as soon as an
armistice for the burial of the dead and the
removal of the wounded could be arranged,
they came to my help. I was carried to a large
storehouse near the Cooper River which had
been turned into a temporary hospital, and
there Dr. Burns of our own frigate gave me
his special care. My wound, though serious,
did not reach the danger point, and within three
weeks I was able to receive visitors. Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
Tucker was the first, and when left alone for
a few minutes, he bent over my cot, and, lowering
his voice, said:</p>

<p>“We have not been able to keep your whereabouts
from the British authorities, my lad.”</p>

<p>“I am not surprised at that,” I replied slowly,
and wondering what else he would tell me.</p>

<p>“They made a search for you at once,” he
continued, “and happened to question one of
our men who was too dull to realize that the
inquiry meant any special danger to you, and
so he told them you were wounded in the last
battle, and had been taken to one of the hospitals.
It was then easy for them to find you,
and they have put the building here under
double guards until you recover, when they are
going to send you to New York.”</p>

<p>I merely nodded an assent, for the revelation,
while not unexpected, nevertheless took all the
talk out of me for the moment.</p>

<p>“I have tried my best to arrange an exchange
for you, but they will not listen to it. So there
is but one thing for us to do—it is to get you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
out of here in some way before they know you
are able to be moved.”</p>

<p>“Can it be done?” I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Dr. Burns, Lieutenant Haines, and I have
been in consultation several times,” he explained,
“but we have not yet hit upon a way
that seems practicable. The Doctor, however,
is making them believe you are much worse
off than you really are, and if he can keep them
in ignorance of your actual condition until you
are able to walk, we still hope to do it. Be of
good courage, therefore, and get strong as fast
as possible. You have escaped them every time
so far, and I believe you will now,” and he left
me.</p>

<p>I tried to be of good heart for I knew my
three friends were all ingenious and resourceful
and would find a way of escape for me were
it possible. But, after all, it was not they, but
the old sailor, Richard Jones—whom I had
rescued from the sea and who had declared he
would make good all I had done for him—who
devised not only a way for my escape, but also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
for putting an end to all further search on the
part of the British authorities for me. It came
about in this way:</p>

<p>He saw me fall on the day of the battle, and
turned at once to see if he could do anything for
me, but before he reached my side was himself
smitten by a bullet which laid him low. Taken
to the same hospital as myself, and put on a
cot in the same ward, almost his first inquiry
when he came to consciousness was about me.
From day to day as he grew weaker he rejoiced
to know that I was growing stronger. Then
there came a time when Dr. Burns had to tell
him that he could live but a few hours.</p>

<p>“I’ve ben waitin’ for that word, Doctor,” he
replied. “Do ye think I can hold out till
night?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the surgeon answered, “and perhaps
until morning.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ve a favor to ax of ye,” the sailor
continued.</p>

<p>“What is it, my good fellow?” Doctor Burns
inquired kindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“That ye put me in Master Dunn’s bed, an’
let me die for him, while he lives as Dick
Jones,” he explained. “Then the red-coats
won’t get him.”</p>

<p>Like a flash the physician recognized the possibility
of the plan. Owing to the scarcity of
surgeons, since the surrender he had been left
in sole charge of that ward. On their tour of inspection
the British had numbered each patient,
putting his name against the number. If he
died, his number was reported, and an order
came for his burial. If he recovered, his number
was also reported, and an order came for
his discharge, and his return to the barracks
of his company.</p>

<p>Jones was number seventy-two in that ward,
while I was number fifty-seven. The change
could be made, and on the death of the old sailor
the report that patient number fifty-seven had
died could be sent to the British officer acting as
superintendent of that building. Doubtless he
would simply issue an order for the burial
without visiting the ward as he had a score of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
times before, and in his records would enter
the fact that number fifty-seven, or Midshipman
Arthur Dunn, had died and was buried;
while upon my discharge the same records
would show that number seventy-two, or Richard
Jones, a sailor, had recovered.</p>

<p>“It shall be done, Richard,” he promised in a
low tone, “and God bless you for thinking of
it.”</p>

<p>That night, with the help of two Continental
soldiers who were acting as nurses, the surgeon
had the change made without explaining to his
assistants why it was done. To me, however,
he made known the whole scheme, and cautioned
me that I was to remember I was Richard
Jones until my exchange was effected.</p>

<p>The next morning the old sailor had joined
the unseen majority, and before night was
buried under my number. We never knew what
the effect of the report was at the British headquarters.
Probably they accepted it as a fact,
as no further inquiry was made concerning me
so far as we ever knew. Three weeks later, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
left the hospital as number seventy-two, or
Richard Jones, to the British authorities—another
fact they never questioned.</p>

<p>Instead of joining my comrades in the barracks
set apart for their use, however, I went
to a boarding-place which my friends had secured
for me, and where I was known by my
assumed name.</p>

<p>But I was there only three days, for on June
26th Captain Tucker and his crew were exchanged
for Captain William Wardlow and
crew, who had been captured by the <i>Boston</i> on
the <i>Thorn</i> twelve months before. As Richard
Jones, sailor, I passed unrecognized before the
English officer in charge of the exchange; and
on the following day the Captain and I started
by the overland route for our home in Marblehead.</p>

<p>We were there only a month, however. Then
Captain Tucker received notice that he was to
take command of the ship <i>Thorn</i>, at that time
in Boston harbor. With that notice came my
own commission as a second lieutenant, and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
assignment to the same vessel. We left at once
for Boston, and boarded the frigate to find to
our delight that she had been put in thorough
repair, furnished with a crew of one hundred
and twenty-five men and her armament increased
to twenty-two guns.</p>

<p>We sailed the following day, making several
cruises during the next three months, running
sometimes as far north as Halifax, and again
south as far as Jamaica. The wonderful success
of Captain Tucker still attended him, and
we captured many prizes, some of which were
of great value.</p>

<p>Then came a cruise so remarkable that it has
been exceeded by no naval commander; so remarkable
that I hesitate to tell of it here lest
the readers may think I exaggerate. Yet it is
but a faithful recital of facts.</p>

<p>We left port on a bright November morning,
and before night sighted a small brig, coming
up from the south. We gave chase and
overhauled her without difficulty. At our first
shot she hove to, and I went off to her. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
proved to be the <i>Lord Hyde</i> from the West
Indies and bound for Halifax with a cargo of
sugar valued at three thousand pounds. A midshipman
was put in command of her, and she
was sent in to Boston.</p>

<p>We changed our course after parting with
the prize and ran to the eastward. The following
morning we discovered a large ship a few
miles away, and as we approached her we found
she carried sixteen guns. This was suggestive
of a valuable cargo, and as she showed a disposition
to fight, we cleared our decks and prepared
for action. A broadside poured into her,
however, brought her to terms, and upon boarding
her we found she was the <i>Alliance</i>, from
Liverpool to Charleston, with a cargo of wine,
brandy, and dry goods inventoried at forty
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The next day was a Sabbath, and proved to
be on our part a day of rest. But the following
day made up for it, as it brought us two prizes.
The first was a letter of marque brig of fourteen
guns, bound from Antigua to Quebec laden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
with rum and molasses, and valued at seven
thousand pounds. The second was a sloop from
Saint Eustatia to Halifax with three hundred
hogsheads of sugar worth six thousand pounds.</p>

<p>We cruised all day Tuesday to the west and
south, and it was nearly night before we sighted
any sail. There was a bright moon, however,
and we could follow her almost as well as in the
day time. Before midnight we had captured
her. She proved to be the brig <i>Venture</i>, from
Madeira to New York with one hundred and
fifty pipes of Madeira wine and a miscellaneous
cargo, valued at ten thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Our next prize cost us a struggle, and the loss
of several men. We had run to the northward
all the forenoon, when our lookout at the masthead
called out that there was a large armed
ship on our weather bow. We changed our
course to overhaul her, and soon found she was
nearly our match as a sailer. For four hours
we strove to come up with her, and I do not
know as we should have done so then had not
the stiff breeze carried away her fore-topmast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>Finding she could not escape us, she now prepared
for a fight, and as she carried twenty
guns and a large crew, she was no mean antagonist.
Captain Tucker attempted several
times to grapple with her, desiring to throw a
boarding party on her deck, but she avoided
him every time, and poured a broadside into us.
We returned the fire, and both vessels had received
considerable damage when a mistake by
the Englishman’s pilot caused her to foul with
us. Here was the opportunity for which we
had been looking, and in another minute our
boarders poured over her rail and down her
deck.</p>

<p>The British commander was plucky, and not
until a score of his men were killed and he himself
was wounded, did he strike his flag. We
then found the vessel was the <i>Dean Swift</i>, from
London to New York, with a cargo of dry
goods which invoiced thirty thousand pounds,
besides four thousand barrels of provisions,
and fifty puncheons of rum.</p>

<p>Thursday we had worked off to the southward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
and about noon ran in with the brigantine
<i>Boyd</i>, from Jamaica for Quebec, and laden with
sugar, coffee, and tobacco, and valued at fifteen
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Early Friday morning we found a brig not
a mile from us. Like ourselves she was becalmed,
but our boats went off to her and captured
her without difficulty. She proved to be
the brig <i>Patsey</i>, bound from Liverpool to the
West Indies with an assorted cargo worth eight
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>For Saturday there was reserved for us the
crowning prize of the week. We had again
taken a course to the north, and were off Massachusetts
bay when we sighted her. Our lookout
reported her as a large ship, heavily laden, and
carrying eighteen guns. We were not slow in
giving chase, nor were we slow in coming up
with her. To our shot across her bow she replied
defiantly with her stern gun. So our men
were drummed to quarters, our guns were shotted,
and our boarders were at their station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
amidships. We were ready for what we expected
to be a gallant fight.</p>

<p>But the ship was so deep in the water she was
unwieldy, while our own frigate responded to
her helm like a thing of life, and before she
could avoid us we had grappled with her and
put thirty men on board. Finding he could not
shake us off, nor withstand the impetus of our
boarding party, her commander speedily surrendered.
She was the ship <i>Dolphin</i>, from London
with supplies of all kinds for the British
troops—the invoice showing a value of more
than seventy-five thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p>We had been out nine days and taken nine
prizes, with a total value of not less than two
hundred thousand pounds. But our crew had
now become so depleted by the constant drain
upon it, we were no longer in a condition to continue
our voyage. So we sailed for Boston
where we arrived safely; with the <i>Dolphin</i>, and
where we found the other eight prizes had preceded
us. Quite a sensation was created by our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
extraordinary luck, and not only among our
own men, but in shipping circles to this day
they speak of it as “the cruise of the nine.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>CAPTURED BY THE HIND</small></h2>
</div>

<p>There is an ebb in the current of fortune as
well as in the deep. The neap tides often follow
the highest flood of prosperity. We set out
on another cruise, our tenth, and as I now attempt
to write of it, it brings to mind the old
Roman adage: “The tenth wave surged.”</p>

<p>Our misfortunes began with a storm so severe
and prolonged I even now recall our
experiences with dread. All day the clouds had
been gathering; the wind blew from the north-east,
and there was that peculiar sough in it,
which through a long life at sea I have come to
recognize as the indication of an unusual tempest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>Towards sundown the temperature suddenly
grew colder, and a fine sleet began to fall. Soon
deck and spars and sails were covered with an
icy garment which made it difficult to keep one’s
feet and to handle the shrouds and guys. Before
midnight the wind had increased to such
violence the stiffened canvas could not stand
before it, and cracked and split and shivered
to pieces like sheets of thin glass. We were
soon obliged to turn and run before the gale
under bare poles, while the great waves followed
us like monsters seeking to devour us.</p>

<p>For four days there was no let-up to the
storm, and our ship became so top-heavy with
its cargo of ice and snow we staggered along
like a drunken man. Then the wind suddenly
changed to the south-east, the temperature
moderated, the snow and sleet turned to rain,
and for twenty-four hours we were driven to
the north-west at a more furious pace than that
with which we had taken our southing. Spiteful
as the tempest was, however, it was not so
disagreeable as the first. We were saved the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
biting cold, and the ropes and sails could be
worked more readily and to better advantage.</p>

<p>We were just beginning to congratulate ourselves
that the force of the gale was spent when
the wind whipped again into the north-east, and
the experiences of the first four days were repeated
and prolonged to nearly a week. In
fact, we escaped the clutches of the norther
only by being driven so far south the icy hand
that grasped us had to yield before the warm
breezes of the semi-tropics.</p>

<p>It took us another week to repair the damages
we had suffered, to get out and bend to
their places our spare sails, and to regain the
course we were on when the storm first struck
us.</p>

<p>Then followed a month during which we did
not sight a vessel; it seemed as though the gale
had swept clean the surface of the ocean, and
left us the sole survivor of its fury.</p>

<p>The month of failure to discover a sail was
succeeded by two weeks during which every
ship we sighted ran away from us, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
they came to an end we had been eight weeks
at sea without so much as the ghost of a prize
to cheer our hearts.</p>

<p>We now were off the mouth of the St. Lawrence,
and the orders had been given us to take
a homeward course, when our lookout called
out:</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy! Two points off our weather
bow. She’s a large ship, and carries the English
colors.”</p>

<p>Hoping at last we had found a prize, so that
we need not return to port empty-handed, we
changed our helm, and ran down towards her.</p>

<p>We had not gone a mile before the man at the
masthead again called out:</p>

<p>“She’s a British frigate, a big one, sir, and
she has headed down this way.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Barrows, our executive officer,
sprang into the shrouds and gazed at the ship
through his glass for some minutes. Then he
jumped down, saying to me:</p>

<p>“It is the <i>Hind</i>, Sir William Young commander,
and carrying fifty-four guns. I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
seen her too many times to be mistaken. Will
you notify the Captain, Lieutenant Dunn?”</p>

<p>Somewhat startled by his announcement, for
I knew if he was right the <i>Thorn</i> was no match
for so formidable an antagonist, I hurried
away to inform Captain Tucker.</p>

<p>He came to the deck and took a good look at
the approaching frigate, and then he said:</p>

<p>“I presume you are correct in your surmise
about yonder vessel, Lieutenant Barrows. She
certainly carries more than double our number
of guns, and probably has a crew triple our
own. So I have got to do what I never did
before, and what I do now with very bad grace,
I assure you—I must run away from a British
ship. We are no match for her.”</p>

<p>He gave the order to about ship and to spread
every stitch of canvas we could carry to the stiff
breeze then blowing from the north-west. In
a few minutes the <i>Hind</i> was under a similar
cloud of canvas, and the race which meant escape
or capture for us was begun.</p>

<p>We were soon making ten knots, and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
three hours the British frigate did no better.
The distance between the ships certainly had
not lessened, and we began to hope that we
might shake off our pursuer. But the ill-luck
which so far had attended us during that voyage
continued to manifest itself. All at once,
and without the slightest warning our maintopmast
snapped in two and came tumbling
down to the deck. It struck our first officer and
two seamen, knocking the former overboard,
and injuring the latter so that they had to be
taken down below and put under the surgeon’s
care. We hove to as soon as we could, and put
over a boat for the unfortunate officer. He was
a good swimmer and managed to keep afloat
until we came up with him; but a half-hour had
elapsed before we were back on board the ship,
and in that half-hour the <i>Hind</i> had so gained
upon us there were but two things we could do,
and we must take our choice between them: to
fight or to surrender.</p>

<p>We chose the former, large as our foe was;
so the drum beat our men to quarters; our guns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
were shotted; and, with about as much hope
of victory as a bantam might have in a contest
with a game-cock, we turned to meet the enemy.</p>

<p>She was evidently surprised at our action,
and was, therefore, not ready for the fight quite
so soon as ourselves. That gave us a slight advantage,
and we poured a broadside into her
before she fired a gun.</p>

<p>But she soon made up for her delay, and for
some minutes the unequal contest waged. Great
gaps were torn in our sides; our decks were
swept; our sails were riddled; a score or more
of our men were killed or wounded.</p>

<p>But the <i>Hind</i> had also suffered. Our guns
had been aimed largely at her rigging, for it
was the hope of Captain Tucker to so disable
her that she would be unable to follow him, and
then he would continue his flight. The time for
that movement now seemed to be ripe, for her
foremast had been shot away, and the spars of
her mizzen and mainmasts sadly injured. So
he gave the command to sheer off and sail away.</p>

<p>We were coming about when a well directed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
shot from the Britisher, who had divined our
purpose, struck our rudder, breaking it into
splinters and causing our frigate to spin around
like a top. We were helpless, and in another instant
the <i>Hind</i> had grappled with us, and
poured a large boarding party down upon our
deck.</p>

<p>There was a short hand-to-hand fight, and
then, overpowered by numbers, Captain Tucker
did the only thing he could do to save the remnant
of his men—he surrendered.</p>

<p>Only thirty-eight of our crew were able to line
up on the deck of the <i>Hind</i> and answer to our
names as they were called from the ship’s
roster; forty-five more of our men were alive
but so severely wounded they were under the
surgeon’s care, while forty-two had been slain.</p>

<p>The Englishmen had not passed through the
struggle unscathed, however. More than one
hundred of them had been killed or wounded,
and it was clear from the deference shown us
by Captain Young that the battle we had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
able to put up with our small numbers had won
his respect.</p>

<p>It seems to me now as I recall the fight that
it was a singular circumstance that both Captain
Tucker and myself should have come out
of it unharmed. I know he was ever at the
front of his men, and I am not conscious that I
in any way attempted to shield myself, yet it
remains a fact, unaccountable though it may
be except on the belief that an overruling Providence
protected us, we had not received the
slightest injury.</p>

<p>Our brother officers had not fared so well.
Lieutenant Barrows, saved only a half-hour
before from a watery grave, was one of the
first among us to be slain. Our third officer, and
two of our five midshipmen had been wounded,
and one of our midshipmen killed. There had
been even greater havoc among our warrant
officers, as all but four had given up their lives
in defense of the flag they loved so well, and the
four who survived were among the wounded.</p>

<p>Proud that his men had fought so well, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
grieved over the terrible loss among them, Captain
Tucker asked, after our names had been
taken, that we might be permitted to care for
the injured—a request firmly though courteously
refused.</p>

<p>“It would be a departure from our usual
custom,” Sir William said, “but I promise you
that they shall have the best care we can give
them, the care that such brave men deserve.”</p>

<p>For ourselves, men and officers alike, we were
sent to the brig, where we were closely guarded
until the <i>Hind</i> could reach port in the Isle of
St. Jean, now Prince Edward Island.</p>

<p>As I lay there in the darkness of the hold,
I wondered over the fact that when I had responded
to the name of Lieutenant Arthur
Dunn, the officer calling the roll had manifested
no surprise or seemed to attach no special significance
to it. It was so different from the
treatment I had been accustomed to receive
when the name was given to the British officials,
I could not help calling the attention of the Captain
to the circumstance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“It may be they think you are some other
Dunn,” he suggested. “It is not an uncommon
name, and the higher rank here, and reported
death at Charleston may help to conceal your
identity.”</p>

<p>“They may forget, too, that I am five years
older now than when I first left the <i>Saint
George</i>,” I added, “and so are looking for a
younger person.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” he acknowledged, “though I
think the official record of your death does more
to prevent the recognition than all else. But
whatever the reason for this failure to identify
in the lieutenant the runaway midshipman, let
us be thankful for it. It will doubtless save us
many anxious moments in the days that are to
come.”</p>

<p>We were forty-eight hours in the <i>Hind</i>, and
then she arrived at Charlottetown, where we
were transferred to the garrison and put under
the care of the commandant, General William
Patterson, who was also the governor of the
colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>Within the walls of the fort there was a huge
log building used as a prison, and in this we
were confined. For some reason never known
to us, our officers were now separated from our
crew, the latter being put in the large room with
the other prisoners, while we were given a small
room directly back of the office of the prison
overseer. It may be the authorities thought we
would be safer where the superintendent could
keep his eye on us.</p>

<p>Our confinement was irksome, but nothing
like what I had experienced in the Halifax
prison a few years before. We had a clean
room, there was plenty of fresh air, good water,
and wholesome, though coarse food, and there
was no disease. As the hot months came on,
however, the tediousness of our confinement
grew upon us. We became restless, and one
day the Captain put into words what for some
time had been in the thoughts of us all:</p>

<p>“We can’t stand this much longer, lads. We
must find a way to get out of here, and back to
our homes. If we are ever to do it, this is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
time. When the cold weather comes on everything
will be against the attempt.”</p>

<p>From that day we talked of nothing else,
planned for nothing else.</p>

<p>It was the Captain who finally hit upon a
scheme which we hoped would succeed. Our
room was in the south-west corner of the prison,
the west side of the apartment forming a part
of the rear of the building. This we knew could
not be far from the west wall of the fort, but as
there was no window on that side we could not
tell exactly how far.</p>

<p>With a knife allowed us for cutting our food
the Captain one day made a small aperture between
the logs which had been hewed so
smoothly as to fit tightly together. Placing his
eye to this, he made his own estimation of the
distance to the wall, and then had each of us in
turn make his estimate. Comparing notes, we
found we did not differ two feet in our opinions
of the distance—ten feet being the longest
amount guessed by any of us.</p>

<p>“Very well,” commented our leader, “we will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
now allow five feet for the thickness of the wall,
an ample allowance. That will make fifteen feet
from here to the outside—not a long distance,
surely, and one the six of us here ought to be
able to tunnel in two or three weeks.”</p>

<p>“But to dig a tunnel we must get under the
floor,” I objected. “How are we to do that?”</p>

<p>Our berths were arranged in a double tier on
the north side of the room, the Captain occupying
one of the lower ones and I the other. In
answer to my question he led us over there, and,
removing the blanket from his own berth,
showed us how one of the bottom boards had
cracked in two under his weight.</p>

<p>“It broke just before I got up this morning,”
he explained, “and when I arose I took a look
at it to see how serious the damage was. Then
I discovered this,—” as he spoke he bent the
two ends of the board downwards until they
had parted several inches at the center, and we
all saw what he meant. The floor of the room
did not extend under the tier of berths, and we
were looking down upon the bare ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>Of course, the broken board did not give us
an aperture wide enough even for the smallest
of us to crawl through, but with the knife that
had served to make the small opening between
the logs we at length succeeded in cutting out
the entire bottom of the captain’s berth, and
then any of us could crawl beneath the building
at his will.</p>

<p>Rude paddles were made from the pieces of
boards we had removed, and that night the
tunnel was begun. I will not attempt to describe
the feverish anxiety with which we slowly dug
our way down the passage that we believed
would finally give us the one thing we desired
above all others—our liberty.</p>

<p>We worked only through the night hours,
carefully covering all traces of our work during
the day. First we sank a pit about four feet
deep, and large enough for us to turn around in.
The dirt from this we hoisted in a blanket and
emptied it in the open space under the floor of
the building.</p>

<p>Then the real tunnel began. We made it big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
enough for the largest man among us to crawl
in and out easily. The dirt from this was
pushed back to the pit, from which it was removed
to the open space under the floor.</p>

<p>The work went slowly. We gained only
about twelve inches each night, and therefore
over two weeks elapsed before we had gone the
fifteen feet which we had estimated would carry
us beyond the outer wall of the fort. All was
now ready for our last task, the making of the
opening from the tunnel into the open air. We
reserved this for the last night—the night we
hoped to escape, and waited therefore for one
that would be favorable in every respect for the
enterprise. It came on the last night of July, at
the end of the seventeenth day since we had
begun the digging, a rainy, drizzly evening
when a dark pall hung over the fort and all its
surroundings.</p>

<p>Captain Tucker had asked that his own hands
might do the last work, and about nine o’clock
he entered the tunnel for that purpose. Midshipman
Lawrence attended him to draw back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
the blanket as he filled it with dirt. The rest of
us gathered about the inner opening, waiting
for the word that should send us down the passage
one by one—down the passage to the outer
world from which we had been shut off for
weeks.</p>

<p>Three times Master Lawrence drew back the
filled blanket for us to empty. The third time
he said:</p>

<p>“The Captain had one hand up through the
surface when I started back here. He says we
are beyond the fort wall, and by the time we can
come out there one after the other, he will have
the opening large enough for us to pass through.
So come on.”</p>

<p>The order of our going had been pre-arranged.
I was to be the last. One by one I saw
my comrades go down the tunnel, and then I
entered. As rapidly as I could I crept along,
touching now and then the heels of the man in
front of me. Then he rose to his feet, and I
knew we had reached the outlet. I could even
feel the fresh air as it blew down upon me. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
good it felt! One quick spring and I would be
free!</p>

<p>An exclamation from the man in front of me
as he went out of the opening—an exclamation
quickly smothered as it seemed to me—reached
my ear. I wondered what it could mean, but
there was no time now for investigation, nor
even for hesitation. So up I arose, placed my
hands on the firm ground, and leaped out of the
hole into the arms of two British soldiers who
were waiting to capture me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I struggled with my captors for a while, not
so much because I expected to escape from
them, but in hopes that I would thereby aid my
companions in their flight. For I could neither
see nor hear anything of them, and believed I
was the only one who had been seized by the
British guards. At length I ceased my efforts,
and, yielding to the inevitable, let them lead me
away. They conducted me around the prison
to its front entrance and took me into the superintendent’s
office, where to my amazement I
beheld all my comrades, each like myself in the
grasp of two soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>There was a broad grin on the face of the
prison overseer as he gazed at us, and then addressing
himself to Captain Tucker, he said:</p>

<p>“It was a neat little game, Captain, I admit
that, and with some it might have succeeded,
but not with me. Why, sir, let me show you
that I have known of your scheme from the beginning.
See here—” and turning to the partition
back of his chair, he pushed aside an old
garment that was hanging there, disclosing a
small aperture, about the size of a walnut on
that side of the wall, but tapering down to a
small point on the side of our room. “With the
coat hanging there to shut out the light,” he
continued, “you did not notice the tiny opening,
and did not suspect that many times each day I
either had my eye upon you, or my ear was
where I could hear all you were saying,” and he
glanced at his prisoner with a complacent air
which said: “I was more than a match for
you.”</p>

<p>Then he went on:</p>

<p>“Oh! I knew you were a shrewd fellow, Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
Tucker, and had outwitted more than one
of our officers before now, but I was determined
you should not outwit me. So I put you
and your subalterns in there where I could literally
keep you under my eye. I saw you the
night you cut out the boards of your berth, and
immediately suspected your plan, but purposely
allowed you to go on to the end. I was outside
the prison watching when your hand first broke
through the surface. Then I called my men, for
I had arranged a little plan, too, and captured
each one of you as you came out of the tunnel,
and marched you in here. I assure you the joke
is on you,” and he threw back his head and
laughed immoderately.</p>

<p>It was no laughing matter for us, however,
and we were a crest-fallen group as we stood
there looking first at our captors and then at
each other, and realizing that our weeks of hard
toil had availed us nothing.</p>

<p>But the worst was yet to come.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I am going to do with
you?” the jailer asked when his laughter was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
over. “Of course you don’t, so I will tell you.
I am going to put you right back into that room
tonight, and leave the passage open, and you
are at liberty to go out if you wish. Only remember
twelve good men are to be stationed
outside with orders to pick you off as you come
out of your hole like so many woodchucks,” and
again he laughed as though he had perpetrated
another good joke.</p>

<p>Nor was he yet done.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow,” he added, “I shall have you
fill up the hole you have taken such pains to dig.
It will be quite a job to put all that dirt back,
but since you thrived while digging it out, you
doubtless will enjoy putting it back. The additional
exercise will be good for you,” and for
the third time he laughed heartily.</p>

<p>This is where the worst came in. He kept his
word to the letter. Back into the room we were
marched and left to ourselves. There the opening
stared silently at us. We knew it led out
into the open air, but not one of us cared to
make use of it; and the next morning under a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
guard of soldiers we were forced to fill up the
tunnel we had been so long in digging.</p>

<p>The day after this enforced task was completed
the overseer came to our room. He
looked us over quizzically, and then remarked:</p>

<p>“You look tired, gentlemen, and hardly as
though you were in a good condition for a long
journey, and yet I am compelled to ask you to
take one. The governor seems to think you are
going to be more of a burden here than he cares
to have on his hands, so he has decided to send
you down to Halifax. At sunrise tomorrow you
will start, and I wish you a pleasant journey, a
safe arrival, and a long stay in the stoutest jail
we have in all the colonies,” and with mock politeness
he bowed himself out of our presence.</p>

<p>The sun was just peeping above the horizon
the next morning when we were taken down to
the river and put on board an open boat, already
manned with an officer and ten men. The
jailer himself had accompanied us, and his directions
to the lieutenant in whose care he
placed us were brief but to the point:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>“Here are the prisoners, sir; and the governor
says you are to deliver them alive or dead
to the governor at Halifax, and take a receipt
for them. It matters little the condition they
are in—the point is to deliver them, so you will
know what to do if they attempt to make you
any trouble,” and the grin we had so often seen
was again upon his face.</p>

<p>Then the ropes were cast off, the sail was
hoisted, and the voyage begun—a voyage destined
to have an outcome very different from
what anyone in the boat, or even the watching
official on the shore, expected.</p>

<p>The wind was from the north, and we soon
ran out of Hillsborough bay into Northumberland
Strait, which we crossed to Cape St.
George, where we went on shore for dinner.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of us did not mean to
give us any opportunity either to run away from
him or to overpower himself and men, for the
moment the boat touched the shore he marched
us up to a large tree not far from the beach.
There he made us sit down, and placed six men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
with loaded guns around us with orders to shoot
us down if we even attempted to rise, a thing we
should have been glad to do as the long hours in
the boat had cramped our limbs and rendered
them stiff and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Under his direction, the other four men built a
fire, cooked the dinner, and with himself partook
of it. The four fed soldiers then changed
places with four of our guards, who had their
rations. The remaining two were then relieved
for their repast. When they were done a small
amount of food was brought to us, but there
was no time during our halt when we were not
under the guard of at least six men, who had
their muskets ready for instant use.</p>

<p>During the afternoon we rounded the Cape,
and going down St. George’s Bay, passed
through the gut of Canso to Chedabucto Bay,
where we ran in to the Isle of Madame for the
night. Within the walls of the garrison and
under a strong guard furnished by the commander,
we were kept securely until the morning,
when our journey was resumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>So far there had been no opportunity for us to
have a single word of private conversation with
one another, and if the same vigilance was maintained
by our guards, we certainly should not
have one. No plan for any concerted action towards
our freedom could therefore be arranged
by us. Yet we all knew by the looks the Captain
occasionally gave us that he was watching for
the moment when we might make such an effort
with some hope of success, and we were all on
the alert to assist him when such a move was
made.</p>

<p>During the night the wind had whipped
around, and now blew mildly from the south. It
took us some time, therefore, to beat out around
Cape Canso to the ocean, and when there what
breeze there was left us. For a long time we
lay there, gently tossing on the ground swell
with the hot sun beating down upon our heads.
The natural effect was for us to grow drowsy,
and after a while even the men holding the
guns were nodding sleepily.</p>

<p>When the lieutenant joined us in the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
he had the appearance of a man who had
been up a good part of the night at his cups,
and it now began to tell upon him. For a while
he struggled to keep awake, and then, handing
over the tiller to one of his men whom he
sternly cautioned to keep a sharp lookout, he
put himself in as comfortable a position as possible,
with his head on the gunwale for a nap.</p>

<p>The heat had a similar effect on us Yankees,
but we had an inducement to keep awake the
red-coats did not have. By a glance at us Captain
Tucker gave us to understand that the favorable
moment for our action was close at hand,
and with the prospect of our liberty before us
we had no difficulty in keeping our eyes open.</p>

<p>Soon after the English officer dropped asleep,
Captain Tucker changed his own position in the
boat to one near the sleeping man. Here he
assumed an easy posture as though he too would
take a nap, yet we knew he was awake and was
preparing to act.</p>

<p>That move came, however, sooner than we
looked for it and in a way we had not expected.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
Catching the lieutenant suddenly by the feet, he
tumbled him overboard, and so adroitly was it
done that to all of his nodding men it had the
appearance of an accidental fall into the sea.</p>

<p>Captain Tucker’s next move also seemed to
confirm this view. Springing to his feet as
though aroused by the splash, he called out excitedly:</p>

<p>“Quick, men! Put out your sweeps! You
must save him! I’ll steer!”</p>

<p>He took the tiller from the bewildered soldier,
and again cried out for the men to get out their
oars.</p>

<p>In the excitement that followed—an excitement
increased by the unfortunate officer’s calls
for help, for his sword and pistols were weighing
him down—the red-coats dropped their
guns and put out the oars. They were awkward
about it, however, and the Captain so
managed the tiller that we were a few minutes
in coming up with the struggling man. Those
few minutes were enough for us, his comrades,
to seize the discarded weapons. Dropping overboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
all but five, we so placed ourselves that,
when the British officer was drawn into the boat
again, we were in command of it.</p>

<p>Under the stern orders of Captain Tucker, enforced
by our loaded muskets, the discomfited
soldiers pulled to the shore where they were
disembarked.</p>

<p>“It cannot be far across the point to Canso,
where you will find friends,” the Captain announced
when they were on the beach. “Your
boat and your provisions we shall need. Good-by,”
and with a bow as polite as that the British
jailer had given us a day or two before, he
waved his hand for us to pull the craft out to
sea.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon the breeze sprang up
again, and we headed the sloop down the coast,
homeward bound, for after some discussion we
decided to run the risk of a voyage in the open
boat to Boston.</p>

<p>In the month of August the sea is usually light
and the weather serene from Nova Scotia to
Massachusetts Bay. We found it so now, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
on the seventeenth arrived in port without mishap.</p>

<p>Bidding good-bye to our comrades, the Captain
and I repaired to Marblehead, where we
awaited the further orders of the Naval Committee.
But two months later Cornwallis surrendered
at Yorktown, and the war for the independence
of the Colonies was over.</p>

<p>The navy, therefore, no longer needed us, and
we resigned our commissions to go back to the
foreign trade. For several years the Captain
ran a large ship to French and Spanish ports,
on which I served as first mate. Then I was
given command of a brig in the East India
trade and the Captain and I did not see each
other for some years.</p>

<p>The War of 1812 sent us back to the navy in
which he rose to the rank of a Commodore,
while I won a Captain’s commission. At its
close he retired to a farm he had purchased in
Bristol, Maine, while I again sailed for foreign
ports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>It was never my good fortune to visit him in
his new home but once; but I have many times
since stood by his grave and read the few lines
written on his tombstone, a just tribute to the
man and his service:</p>

<p>To this I would personally add:</p>

<p>“And the truest friend I ever knew.”</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>By</i> JEAN K. BAIRD</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>Illustrated by</i> <span class="smcap">R. G. Vosburgh</span>.</p>

<p>At The Hall, a boys’ school, there is a set of boys
known as the “Union of States,” to which admittance
is gained by excelling in some particular the boys deem
worthy of their mettle.</p>

<p>Rush Petriken, a hunchback boy, comes to The Hall,
and rooms with Barnes, the despair of the entire school
because of his prowess in athletics. Petriken idolizes
him, and when trouble comes to him, the poor crippled
lad gladly shoulders the blame, and is expelled. But
shortly before the end of the term he returns and is
hailed as “little Rhody,” the “capitalest State of all.”</p>

<p>Four boys, all bubbling over with energy and love
of good times, and their mother, an authoress, make
this story of a street-car strike in one of our large
cities move with leaps and bounds. For it is due to
the four boys that a crowded theatre car is saved from
being wrecked, and the instigators of the plot captured.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ransom is widely known by her patriotic work
among the boys in the navy, and she now proves herself
a friend of the lads on land by writing more especially
for them.</p>

<p class="ph2">FAR PAST THE FRONTIER.</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>By</i> JAMES A. BRADEN</p>

<p>The sub-title “Two Boy Pioneers” indicates the nature of this
story—that it has to do with the days when the Ohio Valley and
the Northwest country were sparsely settled. Such a topic is an
unfailing fund of interest to boys, especially when involving a
couple of stalwart young men who leave the East to make their
fortunes and to incur untold dangers.</p>

THE WESTERN RESERVE</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>By</i> JAMES A. BRADEN</p>

<p>The author once more sends his heroes toward the setting sun.
“In all the glowing enthusiasm of youth, the youngsters seek their
fortunes in the great, fertile wilderness of northern Ohio, and
eventually achieve fair success, though their progress is hindered
and sometimes halted by adventures innumerable. It is a lively,
wholesome tale, never dull, and absorbing in interest for boys who
love the fabled life of the frontier.”—<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p class="ph2">THE TRAIL <i>of</i> THE SENECA</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>By</i> JAMES A. BRADEN</p>

<p>In which we follow the romantic careers of John Jerome and
Return Kingdom a little farther.</p>

<p>These two self-reliant boys are living peaceably in their cabin
on the Cuyahoga when an Indian warrior is found dead in the
woods nearby. The Seneca accuses John of witchcraft. This means
death at the stake if he is captured. They decide that the Seneca’s
charge is made to shield himself, and set out to prove it. Mad
Anthony, then on the Ohio, comes to their aid, but all their efforts
prove futile and the lone cabin is found in ashes on their return.</p>

<p class="ph2">CAPTIVES THREE</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>By</i> JAMES A. BRADEN</p>

<p>A tale of frontier life, and how three children—two boys and a
girl—attempt to reach the settlements in a canoe, but are captured
by the Indians. A common enough occurrence in the days of our
great-grandfathers has been woven into a thrilling story.</p>
